var paragraphs = ['CHAPTER I. THE FAMILY OF BACH', ' If there is such a thing as inherited aptitude for art it certainly showed itself in the family of Bach. For six successive generations scarcely two or three of its members are found whom nature had not endowed with remarkable musical talent, and who did not make music their profession.', 'Veit Bach, ancestor of this famous family, gained a livelihood as a baker at Pressburg in Hungary.  When the religious troubles of the sixteenth century broke out he was driven to seek another place of abode, and having got together as much of his small property as he could, retired with it to Thuringia, hoping to find peace and security there.  He settled at Wechmar, a village near Gotha, where he continued to ply his trade as a baker and miller. In his leisure hours he was wont to amuse himself with the lute, playing it amid the noise and clatter of the mill.  His taste for music descended to his two sons and their children, and in time the Bachs grew to be a very numerous family of professional musicians, Cantors, Organists, and Town Musicians, throughout  Thuringia.', "Not all the Bachs, however, were great musicians. But every generation boasted some of them who were more than usually distinguished.  In the first quarter of the seventeenth century three of Veit Bach's grandchildren showed such exceptional talent that the Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt thought it worth while to send them at his expense to Italy, then the chief school of music, to perfect themselves in the art.", 'We do not know whether they rewarded the expectations of their patron, for none of their works has survived. The fourth generation of the family produced musicians of exceptional distinction, and several of their compositions, thanks to Johann Sebastian Bach\'s regard for them, have come down to us. The most notable of these Bachs are:Johann Christoph Bach, Court and Town Organist at Eisenach. He was particularly happy in his beautiful melodies and in setting words to music. In the Archives of the Bachs, which was in Carl Philipp Emmanuel\'s possession at Hamburg, there is a Motet by Johann Christoph in which he boldly uses the augmented sixth, a proceeding considered extremely daring in his day. He was also an uncommon master of harmony, as may be inferred from a Cantata composed by him for Michaelmas, to the words "Es erhub sich ein Streit," etc., which has twenty-two obbligato parts in correct harmony. Yet another proof of his rare skill is in the alleged fact that he never played the Organ or Clavier in less than five parts. Carl Philipp Emmanuel had a particularly warm regard for him. I remember the old man playing some of his compositions to me on the Clavier at Hamburg, and how quizzically he looked at me when one of these daring passages occurred.     Johann Michael Bach, Organist and Town Clerk at Gehren. He was the younger brother of Johann Christoph, and like him, a particularly good composer.  The Archives already mentioned contain several of his Motets, including one for eight voices in double chorus, and many compositions for Church use.     Johann Bernhard Bach, Musician in the Prince\'s Kapelle and Organist at Eisenach.He is said to have composed remarkably fine Suites, or Overtures, in the French style.', 'Besides these three men, the Bachs boasted several able composers in the generations preceding Johann Sebastian, men who undoubtedly would have obtained higher positions, wider reputation, and more brilliant fortune if they could have torn themselves from their native Thuringia to display their gifts elsewhere in Germany or abroad. But none of the Bachs seems to have felt an inclination to migrate. Modest in their needs, frugal by nature and training, they were content with little, engrossed in and satisfied by their art, and wholly indifferent to the decorations which great men of that time were wont to bestow on artists as special marks of honour. The fact that others who appreciated them were thus distinguished did not rouse the slightest envy in the Bachs.', 'The Bachs not only displayed a happy contentedness, indispensable for the cheery enjoyment of life, but exhibited a clannish attachment to each other.  They could not all live in the same locality.  But it was their habit to meet once a year at a time and place arranged beforehand.  These gatherings generally took place at Erfurt, Eisenach, and sometimes at Arnstadt.  Even after the family had grown very large, and many of its members had left Thuringia to settle in Upper and Lower Saxony and Franconia, the Bachs continued their annual meetings.  On these occasions music was their sole recreation.  As those present were either Cantors, Organists, or Town Musicians, employed in the service of the Church and accustomed to preface the day\'s work with prayer, their first act was to sing a Hymn.  Having fulfilled their religious duty, they spent the rest of the time in frivolous recreations.  Best of all they liked to extemporise a chorus out of popular songs, comic or jocular, weaving them into a harmonious whole while declaiming the words of each. They called this hotch-potch a "Quodlibet," laughed uproariously at it, and roused equally hearty and irrepressible laughter in their audience. It is suggested that German Comic Opera has its origin in these trifles.  But the "Quodlibet" was a familiar institution in Germany at a much earlier period.  I possess a collection of them printed and published at Vienna in', " But these light-hearted Thuringians, and even those of their family who treated their art more seriously and worthily, would not have escaped oblivion had there not emerged in the fulness of time one whose genius and renown reflected their splendour and brilliancy on his forbears.  This man, the glory of his family, pride of his countrymen, most gifted favourite of the Muse of Music, was Johann Sebastian Bach.  [Bach's Home at Eisenach]   Bach's Home at EisenachCHAPTER II. THE CAREER OF BACH", ' Johann Sebastian Bach was born on March 21, 1685, at Eisenach, where his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was Court and Town Musician. Johann Ambrosius had a twin brother, Johann Christoph, Musician to the Court and Town of Arnstadt, who so exactly resembled him that even their wives could distinguish them only by their dress.  The twins appear to have been quite remarkable.  They were deeply attached, alike in disposition, in voice, and in the style of their music.  If one was ill, so was the other. They died within a short time of each other, and were objects of wondering interest to all who knew them.', "In 1695, when Johann Sebastian was not quite ten years old, his father died. He lost his mother at an earlier period. So, being left an orphan, he became dependent on his eldest brother, Johann Christoph, Organist at Ohrdruf, from whom he received his earliest lessons on the Clavier. His inclination and talent for music must already have been pronounced.  For his brother no sooner had given him one piece to learn than the boy was demanding another more difficult.  The most renowned Clavier composers of that day were Froberger, Fischer, Johann Caspar Kerl, Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Bruhns, and Böhm. Johann Christoph possessed a book containing several pieces by these masters, and Bach begged earnestly for it, but without effect.  Refusal increasing his determination, he laid his plans to get the book without his brother's knowledge.  It was kept on a book-shelf which had a latticed front.  Bach's hands were small.  Inserting them, he got hold of the book, rolled it up, and drew it out.  As he was not allowed a candle, he could only copy it on moonlight nights, and it was six months before he finished his heavy task.  As soon as it was completed he looked forward to using in secret a treasure won by so much labour.  But his brother found the copy and took it from him without pity, nor did Bach recover it until his brother's death soon after.", "Being once more left destitute, Johann Sebastian set out for Lüneburg with one of his Ohrdruf schoolfellows, named Erdmann (afterwards Russian Resident at Danzig), and entered the choir of St. Michael's Convent.  His fine treble voice procured him a fair livelihood. But unfortunately he soon lost it and did not at once develop another. ", "Meanwhile his ambition to play the Organ and Clavier remained as keen as ever, and impelled him to hear and practise everything that promised him improvement.  For that purpose, while he was at Lüeburg, he several times travelled to Hamburg to hear the famous organist, Johann Adam Reinken. Often, too, he walked to Celle to hear the Duke's French band play French music, which was a novelty in those parts.", "The date and circumstances of his removal from Lüneburg to Weimar are not precisely known. He certainly became Court Musician there in 1703, when he was just over eighteen years of age. But in the following year he gave up the post on his appointment as Organist to the new Church at Arnstadt, probably desiring to develop his taste for the Organ and realising that he would have better opportunities to do so at Arnstadt than at Weimar, where he was engaged simply to play the Violin. At Arnstadt he set himself assiduously to study the works of the celebrated organists of the period, so far as his modest means permitted him, and in order to improve himself in composition and Organ playing, walked the whole way to Lübeck to hear Dietrich Buxtehude, Organist of St. Mary's Church in that city, with whose compositions he was acquainted already. He remained there about three months, listening to the celebrated Organist, but without making himself known to him, and returned to Arnstadt with his experience much increased.", "Bach's zeal and persevering diligence had already drawn attention to him, as is evident from the fact that he received in succession several offers of vacant organistships, one of which, at the Church of St. Blasius, Mühlhausen, he accepted in  Barely a year after he entered upon his duties there he again visited Weimar and played to the Duke, who was so pleased with his performance that he offered him the post of Court Organist, which he accepted. Weimar promised him a particularly agreeable atmosphere in which to cultivate his genius. He applied himself closely to his work, and probably at this period achieved the mastery of the Organ that he ever afterwards possessed.  At Weimar also he wrote his great compositions for that instrument. In 1717 the Duke appointed him Concertmeister, a post which gave him further opportunity to develop his art, since it required him to compose and direct Church music.", "It was about this time that Zachau, Handel's master, died at Halle, where he was Organist. Bach, who by now had acquired a great reputation, was invited to succeed him. He visited Halle and composed a work as a specimen of his skill But for some reason unknown he did not obtain the post.  It was given to a clever pupil of Zachau, named Kirchhoff.", "Johann Sebastian was now thirty-two years old. He had made good use of his opportunities, had studied hard as a player and composer, and by tireless enthusiasm had so completely mastered every branch of his art, that he towered like a giant above his contemporaries. Both amateurs and professional musicians already regarded him with admiration when, in 1717, Marchand, the French virtuoso, a celebrated Clavier and Organ player, visited Dresden.  He played before the King-Elector and won such approbation that he was offered a large salary to enter His Majesty's service. Marchand's chief merit was his finished technique.  Like Couperin, his musical ideas were weak to the point of banality, as we may judge from his compositions. Bach was an equally finished player, and so rich in ideas that Marchand's head would have swollen had he been equally gifted.  Volumier, Concertmeister at Dresden, was aware of these circumstances, and knowing that the young German had his instrument and his imagination under the fullest control, determined to arrange a contest between the two men in order to give his sovereign the satisfaction of judging their merits.  With the King's approbation, a message was dispatched to Bach at Weimar inviting him to a contest with Marchand.  Bach accepted the invitation and set out at once on his journey.  Upon his arrival at Dresden Volumier procured him an opportunity to hear Marchand secretly.  Far from being discouraged by what he heard, Bach wrote a polite note to the French artist challenging him to a trial of skill, and offering to play at sight anything Marchand put before him, provided the Frenchman submitted himself to a similar test.  Marchand accepted the challenge, a time and place for the contest were fixed, and the King gave his approval.  At the appointed hour a large and distinguished company assembled in the house of Marshal Count Flemming. Bach arrived punctually; Marchand did not appear.  After considerable delay he was sought at his lodging, when it was discovered, to the astonishment of all, that he had left Dresden that morning without taking leave of anybody.  Bach therefore performed alone, and excited the admiration of all who heard him, though Volumier was cheated of his intention to exhibit the inferiority of French to German art.  Bach was overwhelmed with congratulations; but the dishonesty of a Court official is said to have intercepted a present of one hundred louis d'or sent to him by the King.", 'Bach had not long returned to Weimar when Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen, a good judge of music and a first-rate amateur, offered him the post of Kapellmeister.  He entered at once upon his new office and held it for about six years. At this period, about 1722, he visited Hamburg, played the Organ there, and excited general admiration.  The veteran Reinken--he was nearly one hundred years old--was particularly impressed by Bach\'s performance.  After he had treated the Choral An Wasserflüssen Babylon for half an hour in variation after variation in the true Organ style, Reinken paid him the compliment of saying, "I thought this art was dead, but I see that it survives in you."  Reinken had treated the same Choral in a similar manner some years before and had had his work engraved, showing that he thought highly of it.  His praise therefore was particularly flattering to Bach.', "On the death of Kuhnau in 1723 Bach was appointed Director of Music and Cantor to St. Thomas' School, Leipzig, a position which he occupied until his death.  Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen had great regard for him and Bach left his service with regret. But he saw the finger of Providence in the event; for the Prince died shortly afterwards. The loss of his patron affected him deeply, and moved him to compose a funeral Cantata containing remarkably fine double choruses which he himself conducted at Cöthen. While he was at St. Thomas' he was appointed honorary Kapellmeister to the Duke of Weissenfels and, in the following year , received the title of Court Composer to the King-Elector of Poland-Saxony. The two compliments are not of great consequence, and the second was to some degree corollary to Bach's position as Cantor of St. Thomas' School.", 'Carl Philipp Emmanuel, Bach\'s second son, entered the service of Frederick the Great of Prussia in   So widely was Bach\'s skill recognised by this time that the King, who often heard him praised, was curious to meet so great an artist.  More than once he hinted to Carl Philipp Emmanuel that it would be agreeable to welcome his father to Potsdam, and as Bach did not appear, desired to know the reason.  Carl Philipp did not fail to acquaint his father with the King\'s interest.  But for some time Bach was too occupied with his duties to accede to the invitation.  However, as Carl Philipp continued to urge him, he set out for Potsdam towards the end of 1747, in company with his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann. It was the King\'s custom to hold a private concert every evening, and to take part on the flute in a Concerto or two. One evening, when he had got out his flute and the musicians were at their desks, an official brought him a list of the strangers newly arrived at Potsdam.  Flute in hand the King ran through the names, and suddenly turning to the waiting musicians, said with considerable excitement, "Gentlemen, Old Bach has arrived."  The flute was put away for the evening, and Bach, who had alighted at his son\'s lodging, was summoned immediately to the Palace.  Wilhelm Friedemann, who accompanied his father, often told me the story.  Nor am I likely to forget the racy manner in which he related it.  The courtesy of those days demanded rather prolix compliments, and the first introduction of Bach to so illustrious a monarch, into whose presence he had hurried without being allowed time to change his travelling dress for a Cantor\'s black gown, obviously invited ceremonial speeches on both sides.  I will not dwell on them; Wilhelm Friedemann related a lengthy and formal conversation between the King and the Cantor.', 'More worthy of record is the fact that the King gave up his concert for that evening and invited Bach, already known as "Old Bach," to try the Silbermann pianofortes which stood in various parts of the Palace. Accompanied from room to room by the King and the musicians, Bach tried the instruments and improvised upon them before his illustrious companion.  After some time he asked the King to give him a subject for a Fugue, that he might treat it extempore.  The King did so, and expressed his astonishment at Bach\'s profound skill in developing it.  Anxious to see to what lengths the art could be carried, the King desired Bach to improvise a six-part Fugue.  But as every subject is not suitable for polyphonic treatment, Bach himself chose a theme and, to the astonishment of all who were present, developed it with the skill and distinction he had shown in treating the King\'s subject.  His Majesty expressed a wish to hear him on the Organ also. Accordingly, next day, Bach inspected all the Organs in Potsdam, as the evening before he had tried the Silbermann pianofortes. On his return to Leipzig he developed the King\'s theme in three and six parts, added Canones diversi upon it, engraved the whole under the title Musikalisches Opfer and dedicated it to the royal author of the theme.', "His visit to Potsdam was Bach's last journey.  The indefatigable diligence he had shown all his life, and particularly in his younger years, when successive days and nights were given to study, seriously affected his eye-sight.  The weakness grew with age and became very distressing in character.  On the advice of friends who placed great confidence in the skill of a London oculist lately come to Leipzig, Bach submitted to an operation, which twice failed.  He lost his sight completely in consequence, and his hitherto vigorous constitution was undermined by the drugs administered to him.  He sank gradually for full half a year, and expired on the evening of July 30, 1760, in the sixty-sixth year of his age. Ten days before his death he was suddenly able to see again and to bear the light.  A few hours later he was seized by an apoplexy and inflammatory fever, and notwithstanding all possible medical aid, his weakened frame succumbed to the attack.", 'Such was the career of this remarkable man.  I will only add that he was twice married, and that he had by his first wife seven, and by his second wife thirteen children; in all, eleven sons and nine daughters. All of his sons had an admirable talent for music, but only the elder ones fully developed it.     [The Church and School of St. Thomas, Leipzig, in 1723.]The Church and School of St. Thomas, Leipzig, in CHAPTER IIA. BACH AT LEIPZIG, 1723-1750', " Bach was inducted into his office as Cantor of St. Thomas' School at nine o'clock on the morning of Monday, May 31,   He died in his official residence there at a quarter to nine on the evening of Tuesday, July 28,", " He was buried early on the morning of Friday, July 31, in the churchyard of St. John's, Leipzig.", 'The announcement of his death, made from the pulpit of St. Thomas\' on the day of his funeral, described him as "Court Composer to His Majesty the King of Poland and Electoral and Serene Highness of Saxony, Kapellmeister to His Highness the Prince of Anhalt-Cothen, and Cantor to St. Thomas\' School of this town."  Bach usually designated himself "Director Chori Musici Lipsiensis," or shortly, "Director Musices."  Circumstances led him to emphasise a title which asserted a musical prerogative not confined to the School and the churches it served.', 'The Cantor of St. Thomas\' was charged formerly with the musical direction of four Leipzig churches: St. Thomas\', St. Nicolas\', St. Peter\'s, and the New Church.  He was also responsible for the music in the University Church of St. Paul, the so-called "old service," held originally on the Festivals of Easter, Whit, Christmas, and the Reformation, and once during each University quarter. On high days music also had to be provided at St. John\'s Church.', 'Bach, as Cantor, succeeded to a more restricted responsibility, which dated from the early years of the eighteenth century.  The New Church, originally the Church of the Franciscans, had been restored to use in', ' In 1704 Georg Philipp Telemann, who came to Leipzig as a law student three years before, was appointed Organist there. He also founded the Collegium Musicum, or University Musical Society, a farther slight upon the Cantor\'s position.  Not until 1729 did the Society pass under Bach\'s direction and its members become available as auxiliaries in the church choirs under his charge.  Notwithstanding that Bach\'s predecessor Kuhnau had protested against Telemann\'s independence, the direction of the New Church\'s music passed out of the Cantor\'s control, though the School continued to provide the choristers.  Six years later the University Church of St. Paul also began an independent course.  In 1710 the authorities resolved to hold a University service in the church every Sunday. Kuhnau asserted his prerogative as Cantor. But he was only able to maintain it by offering to provide the music for the "new service" as well as for the "old service" at the fee of twelve thalers which the University so far had paid for the latter.  After his death the University appointed (April 3, 1723) Johann Gottlieb Görner, already Organist of St. Nicolas\' since 1721, to control the music both of the "old" and "new" services, for which the University provided the choir.  Not until after a direct appeal to the King did Bach succeed, in 1726, in compelling the University to restore to the Cantor his emoluments in regard to the "old service," the conduct of which had been restored to him on his appointment as Cantor. The "new service" remained under Görner\'s direction.  As to St. Peter\'s, its services, which had entirely ceased, were revived in  The music, however, was simple, and consisted only of hymns.', "Thus Bach, as Cantor, was responsible for the music in the two principal churches, St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas'.  The School also provided the choir for St. Peter's and the New Church.  The junior and least competent singers sang at St. Peter's.  The rest were pretty equally distributed between the other three churches.  At the New Church the music was performed under the direction of a Chorpräfect.  At St. Thomas' and St. Nicolas' Bach personally directed the concerted music.  On ordinary Sundays a Cantata or Motet was performed in each church alternately.  At the great Festivals, New Year, Epiphany, Ascension Day, Trinity Sunday, and the Annunciation, Cantatas were sung at both churches, the two choirs singing at Vespers in the second church the Cantata performed by them in the morning at the other church.  On these occasions the second choir was conducted by a Chorpräfect. The principal Sunday service in both churches began at seven in the morning, ended at eleven, and observed the following order:   Organ Prelude.  Motet, related to the Gospel for the Day; (omitted in Lent and replaced by the Benedictus).  Introit.  Kyrie, sung alternately, in German and Latin.  The Lord's Prayer, intoned at the altar.  Gloria, intoned at the altar and answered either by the Choir's Et in terra pax hominibus, or by the congregation with the Hymn, Allein Gott in der Höh' sei Ehr, the German version of the Gloria.  Collect, intoned in Latin; preceded by the preces Dominus vobiscum and Et cum spiritu tuo.  Epistle.  Litany, in Advent and Lent only; intoned by four boys, the Choir responding.  Hymn, appropriate to the Gospel.  Gospel.  Credo, intoned; (in Lent, last three Sundays of Advent, and Festivals of Apostles, the Nicene Creed, sung in Latin).  Prelude, followed by a Cantata, lasting about twenty minutes; on alternate Sundays in each church.  The Creed in German, Wir glauben all' an einen Gott, sung by the congregation.  Sermon, lasting one hour (8-9 A.M.).  Hymn, Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, followed by the reading of the Gospel, on which the Sermon had been based.  General Confession, prayers, and Lord's Prayer.  Blessing.  Hymn.  Communion Service; Hymns and Organ extemporisation.  Benediction.", "Vespers began at a quarter past one and was a comparatively simple service; the music consisted of Hymns, a Motet, and the Magnificat. On the last three Sundays in Advent and throughout Lent neither Cantatas nor Motets were sung. The Organ was silent. On the three great Festivals the appointed Hymn for the season was sung at the beginning of the principal service, before the Organ Prelude: at Christmas, Puer natus in Bethlehem; at Easter, Heut' triumphiret Gottes Sohn; at Whitsuntide, Spiritus Sancti gratia.  During the Communion service the Sanctus and concerted music were sung.  A festal hymn followed the Benediction.  The three great Festivals were each observed for three consecutive days, on the first and second of which Cantatas were sung at both churches.  On the third day concerted music was sung at only one of the two churches.", "The other week-day Festivals for which Cantatas were provided were the Feast of the Circumcision (New Year's Day), Epiphany, Ascension Day, Purification of the B.V.M., Annunciation of the B.V.M., Visitation of the B.V.M., Feast of St. John Baptist (Midsummer Day), Feast of St. Michael the Archangel. The Reformation Festival was kept on October 31, or if that date was a Saturday or Monday, on the previous or following Sunday.", "On Good Friday the Passion was performed in the two principal churches alternately. Leipzig adopted no official Hymn-book.  The compilation from which the Hymns were chosen by Bach was the eight-volumed Gesangbuch of Paul Wagner, published at Leipzig for Dresden use in   It contained over five thousand Hymns but no music, merely the name of the tune being stated above the Hymn.  For the most part the Hymns for special, and even for ordinary, occasions were prescribed by custom. Otherwise the power of selection was in the hands of the Cantor, and Bach's exercise of it caused some friction with the clergy in ", "The provision and direction of the music at weddings and funerals was in the Cantor's hands. He arranged the choirs and the music sung at the scholars' annual processions and perambulations of the town, which took place at Michaelmas, New Year, and on St. Martin's and St. Gregory's Days.", "Augmenting the School's choristers, the Town Musicians took part in the Church services and were under the Cantor's direction. Their numbers and efficiency were inadequate.", 'Upon the staff of the School the Cantor ranked third after the Rector and Sub-Rector, and took a share in the general instruction of the scholars. Class III. went to Bach for Latin lessons, a duty which the Council eventually permitted him to fulfil by deputy.  Singing classes were held by the Cantor on three days of the week, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, at nine and noon, and on Fridays at noon.  His instruction in singing was given to the four upper classes only.  On Saturday afternoons the Cantata was rehearsed. Once in four weeks the Cantor took his turn to inspect the scholars.  Like the other masters, he was required to conform to the regulations of the School House, in which he lived.  He rose at five in summer, at six in winter, dined at ten and supped at five in the afternoon.', "Holidays were numerous.  A week's vacation was given at the Easter, Michaelmas, and New Year Fairs.  At Midsummer the School had a month of half-holidays.  Whole holidays were given on the birthdays of the four upper masters. There were no morning lessons on Saints' Days, on the occasion of funeral orations in the University Church, and on the quarterly Speech Days. Hence, though Bach's office carried large responsibility, it left him considerable leisure for composition.", "As Cantor Bach had an official residence in the left wing of the School House.  In 1723, the Cantor's wing was of two storeys only, dwarfed by the greater elevation of the main edifice and under the shadow of the church. Bach brought to Leipzig four children of his first marriage, and his second wife, Anna Magdalena, presented him with a son or daughter annually from 1723 to   The accommodation of the Cantor's lodging therefore rapidly became inadequate.  In the spring of 1731 Bach found a house elsewhere while an additional storey was added to it, which provided a new music-room, a good-sized apartment whence a passage led to the big schoolroom in the main building.  The new wing was formally opened and dedicated on June 5, 1732, when Bach's secular Cantata Froher Tag, verlangte Stunden was performed; the libretto being by his colleague Winkler.  From thenceforward till his death eighteen years later Bach's occupancy was not disturbed.  The wing continued to be the official residence of the Cantor until the School moved to the suburbs of the city in ", 'In addition to his residence, which he occupied rent free, the Cantor enjoyed a revenue from various and fluctuating sources, amounting in gross to 700 thalers (=£106 per annum).  His fixed stipend was only 100 thalers (=£15).  About 12 thalers came to him from endowments.  In kind he was entitled to 16 bushels of corn and 2 cords of firelogs, together with 2 measures of wine at each of the three great Festivals.  From the University, after his successful protest, he received 12 thalers for directing the "old service." By far the larger part of Bach\'s income was derived from fluctuating sources.  They were of three kinds:  School monies,  funeral fees,  wedding fees.  The School monies represented perquisites derived from funds obtained by the scholars, partly by their weekly collections from the public, partly from the four annual processions or perambulations of the city.  From the weekly collections a sum of six pfennigs multiplied by the number of the scholars was put aside for the four upper masters, among whom the Cantor ranked third.  From the money collected at the New Year, Michaelmas, and St. Martin\'s Day processions the Rector took a thaler, the Cantor and the Sub-Rector each took one-eleventh of the balance, sixteen thirty-thirds went to the singers, and one-quarter of what remained fell to the Cantor.  Out of the money collected on St. Gregory\'s Day (March 12) the Rector took one-tenth for the entertainment of the four upper masters, and the Cantor took one-third of the residue.  For funerals one thaler 15 groschen was paid when the whole school accompanied the procession and a Motet was sung at the house of the deceased.  When no Motet was sung the Cantor\'s fee was 15 groschen. For weddings he received two thalers.', "Reckoned in modern currency, and judged by the standard of the period, the Cantor's income was not inadequate and served to maintain Bach's large family in comfort.  When he died in 1750, in addition to a mining share valued at 60 thalers, he possessed in cash or bonds about 360 thalers, silver plate valued at 251 thalers, instruments valued at 371 thalers, house furniture valued at 29 thalers, and books valued at 38 thalers.  His whole estate was declared at 1158 thalers, or somewhat less than the savings of two years' income.  But for the inequitable distribution of his property, owing to his intestacy, which left Anna Magdalena only about 400 thalers and the mining share, Bach's widow and unmarried daughters ought not to have been afflicted with excessive poverty, as in fact they were.", "At the beginning of his Cantorate Bach worked amid discouraging and unsatisfactory conditions. The Rector, Johann Heinrich Ernesti, was over seventy years of age in   The School was badly managed, its discipline was relaxed, the better-to-do citizens withheld their sons from it, and its numbers were seriously diminished.  In 1717 the junior classes contained only 53 as against 120 in Ernesti's earlier years.  The proximity and operatic traditions of Dresden and Weissenfels also had a bad effect; the St. Thomas' boys, after attaining musical proficiency, were apt to become restless, demanding release from their indentures, and even running away to more attractive and lucrative occupations.  Moreover, the governors of the School were the Town Council, a body which had little sympathy with or appreciation of Bach's artistic aims and temperament. To these difficulties must be added another.  The Town Musicians, on whom Bach relied for the nucleus of his orchestra, were few in number and inefficient.", 'So long as Ernesti lived, there was little prospect of reform.  But, after his death, in October 1729, Bach made vigorous representations to the Town Council.  Already he had remonstrated with the Council for presenting to foundation scholarships boys who lacked musical aptitude.  The Council retaliated by accusing Bach of neglecting his singing classes, absenting himself without leave, and of other irregularities.  He was declared to be "incorrigible" and it was resolved (August 2, 1730) to sequestrate the Cantor\'s income, in other words, to withhold from him the perquisites to which he was entitled for the conduct of the Church services.', 'Bach was not deterred from offering, three weeks later (August 23, 1730), a "sketch of what constitutes well-appointed Church music, with a few impartial reflections on its present state of decay" in Leipzig.  The document reveals the conditions amid which Bach worked.  Its representations may be summarised:', "The foundation scholars of St. Thomas' are of four classes: Trebles, Altos, Tenors, Basses.", 'A choir needs from four to eight "concertists" ( solo singers) and at least two "ripienists" to each chorus part, i.e. a minimum of twelve voices.', "The foundation scholars number fifty-five, by whom the choirs of the four Churches, St. Thomas', St. Nicolas', St. Peter's, and the New Church are provided.  For the instrumental accompaniments at least twenty players are required: viz., 2 or 3 first Violins, 2 or 3 second Violins, 4 Violas, 2 Violoncelli, 1 Contrabasso, 2 or more Flutes, 2 or 3 Oboi, 1 or 2 Fagotti, 3 Trombe, 1 Timpani.  To fill these places there are eight Town Musicians, and at the moment there are no players available for third Tromba, Timpani, Viola, Violoncello, Contrabasso, third Oboe (or Taille).", 'To augment the Town Musicians the Cantor has been wont in the past to employ University students and instrumental players in the School. Upon the former "at all times" he relies for Viola, Violoncello, and Contrabasso, and "generally" for the second Violins.  But the Council, by its recent resolution, no longer affords the Cantor the means to employ them.  To place the scholars in the orchestra weakens the choir, to which they naturally belong.', "By presenting to foundation scholarships boys unskilled and ignorant of music, the resources at the Cantor's disposal are still farther lessened.", 'Hence, Bach concludes, "in ceasing to receive my perquisites I am deprived of the power of putting the music into a better condition."', 'No answer was made to Bach\'s memorial, and he contemplated resigning his position.  But with the advent of Johann Matthias Gesner as Rector in September 1730 a happier period dawned upon the "incorrigible" Cantor.  In 1732 Gesner procured the withdrawal of the Council\'s ban on Bach\'s perquisites.  The fallen fortunes of the School revived, and Bach did not again make an effort to leave Leipzig.  In 1736 the grant of the post of Hof-Componist to the Saxon Court gave him at length a title which compelled the deference of his civic masters.', "Bach's early misunderstanding with the University cut him off from association with the most dignified, if not the most important, institution in Leipzig, and deprived him of opportunity to display his genius beyond the radius of his Church duties.  The situation changed in 1729, when he became director of the University Society, and he held the post for about ten years.  The Society gave weekly concerts on Fridays, from 8 to 10, and an extra concert, during the Fair season, on Thursdays at the same hour.  It performed vocal and instrumental music and was the medium through which Bach presented his secular Cantatas, Clavier and Violin Concertos, and Orchestral Suites to the public.  The proficiency of his elder sons and pupils, and his wife's talent as a singer, were a farther source of strength to the Society, whose direction undoubtedly made these years the happiest in Bach's life.  He took his rightful place in the musical life of the city, and relegated to a position of inferiority the smaller fry, such as Görner, who had presumed on Bach's aloofness from the University and Municipality to insinuate themselves. His increasing reputation as an organist, gained in his annual autumn tours, also enlightened his fellow-townsmen regarding the superlative worth of one whom at the outset they were disposed to treat as a subordinate official.", 'The Leipzig of Bach\'s day offered various opportunities for musical celebration; official events in the University, "gratulations" or "ovations" of favourite professors by their students, as well as patriotic occasions in which town and gown participated. The recognised fee for piecès d\'occasion of a public character was fifty thalers.  Bach\'s conductorship of the University Society enabled him to perform festival works with the resources they required, and to augment the band and chorus needed for their adequate performance.', "Even before he undertook the direction of the University Society, Bach more than once provided the music for University celebrations.  On August 3, 1725, his secular Cantata, Der zufried-engestellte Aeolus, was performed at the students' celebration of Doctor August Friedrich Müller's name-day.  In 1726 he revived an old Cantata to celebrate the birthday of another of the Leipzig teachers.  In the same year the appointment of Dr. Gottlieb Kortte as Professor of Roman Law was celebrated by Bach's Cantata Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden Saiten. In 1733 the birthday of another Professor was marked by the performance of the Cöthen Cantata to yet another text (Die Freude reget sich). On November 21, 1734, the lost Cantata Thomana sass annoch betrübt was sung at the induction of Gesner's successor, Johann August Ernesti, as Rector of St. Thomas' School.", "But Bach's activity as a secular composer at Leipzig was chiefly expended on patriotic celebrations. His compositions of this character are particularly numerous during the years 1733-36, while he was seeking from the Dresden Court the post of Hof-Componist.  The first of these celebrations took place on May 12, 1727, the birthday of Augustus II. of Poland-Saxony, when Bach's Cantata, Entfernet euch, ihr heitern Sterne, was performed in the Market Place by the University Society.  The King was present and listened to the performance from a convenient window.  The music is lost.  Six years elapsed before Bach was invited to collaborate in another celebration of the royal House.  On September 5, 1733, less than two months after his application for the post of Hof-Componist, the University Society celebrated the eleventh birthday of the Electoral Prince by performing Bach's dramma per musica, Die Wahl des Herkules, or Herkules auf dem Scheidewege. Barely three months later, on December 8, 1733, Bach produced another Cantata in honour of the royal family, Tönet, ihr Pauken, erschallet Trompeten, of which he was both author and composer.  On no less than three occasions in 1734 Bach did homage to his unheeding sovereign.  In January the University Society, under Bach's direction, performed his Cantata Blast Larmen, ihr Feinde to celebrate the coronation of Augustus III.  The music had already done duty in Dr. Müller's honour in   On the following October 5, 1734, when the King visited Leipzig, Bach's hurriedly written Cantata, Preise dein Glücke, gesegnetes Sachsen, whose first chorus became the Osanna of the B minor Mass, was performed in the Market Place.  Two days later, on October 7, 1734, the King's birthday was celebrated by another Bach Cantata, Schleicht spielende Wellen, performed by the Collegium Musicum. In 1738, having received the coveted title of Hof-Componist in the interval , Bach performed a work--Willkommen, ihr herrschenden Götter der Erden--now lost, in honour of the marriage of the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony to Charles of Sicily, afterwards Charles III. of Spain.", "Apart from his musical activities and the house in which he lived there is little that permits us to picture Bach's life at Leipzig.  Association with his friends Johann Christian Hoffmann, Musical Instrument Maker to the Court, Marianne von Ziegler, J. C. Gottsched and his musical wife, Johann Abraham Birnbaum, among the Professoriate, Picander and Christian Weiss, Bach's regular librettists, suggests the amenities of an academic and literary circle. But the claims of his art and the care of his large family had the first call upon Bach's interest.  And few men had a happier home life.  While his elder sons were at home the family concerts were among his most agreeable experiences.  As his fame increased, his house became the resort of many seeking to know and hear the famous organist. Late in the thirties he resigned his directorship of the University Society.  His sons were already off his hands and out of his house, and he turned again to the Organ works of his Weimar period.  Their revision occupied the last decade of his life, and the hitherto constant flow of Church Cantatas ceased. Pupils resorted to him and filled his empty house, to one of whom, Altnikol, he gave a daughter in marriage.", 'A man of rigid uprightness, sincerely religious; steeped in his art, earnest and grave, yet not lacking naive humour; ever hospitable and generous, and yet shrewd and cautious; pugnacious when his art was slighted or his rights were infringed; generous in the extreme to his wife and children, and eager to give the latter advantages which he had never known himself; a lover of sound theology, and of a piety as deep as it was unpretentious--such were the qualities of one who towers above all other masters of music in moral grandeur.', "Four, perhaps only three, contemporary portraits of Bach are known.  One is in the possession of the firm of Peters at Leipzig and once belonged to Carl Philipp Emmanuel's daughter, who with inherited impiety sold it to a Leipzig flute player.  The second hung in St. Thomas' School and is reproduced at p. 48 of this volume.  It was painted in 1746 and restored in   Both portraits are by Elias Gottlieb Haussmann, Court Painter at Dresden. The third portrait belonged to Bach's last pupil, Kittel, and used to hang on the Organ at Erfurt, whence it disappeared after 1809, during the Napoleonic wars.  Recently Professor Fritz Volbach of Mainz has discovered a fourth portrait, which is printed at p. 92 of the present volume. He supposes it to be none other than the Erfurt portrait, as indeed it well may be, since it represents a man of some sixty years, austere in countenance, but of a dignity that is not so apparent in Haussmann's portraiture.", "Bach left no will.  In consequence his widow, Anna Magdalena, burdened with the charge of a step-daughter and two daughters, was entitled to only one-third of her husband's estate.  Neither Carl Philipp Emmanuel nor Wilhelm Friedemann was her own child.  But the fact cannot excuse gross neglect of their father's widow. Her own sons were in a position to make such a contribution to her income as would at least have kept want from her door.  In fact she was permitted to become dependent on public charity, and died, an alms-woman, on February 27, 1760, nearly ten years after her great husband.  The three daughters survived her.  One died in 1774, the second in   The third, Regine Susanna, survived them, her want relieved by gifts from a public that at last was awakening to the grandeur of her father.  Beethoven contributed generously.  Regine Susanna died in December 1809, the last of Bach's children.  In 1845 her nephew, Johann Christoph Friedrich's son, also died.  With him the line of Johann Sebastian Bach expired.", '   [Johann Sebastian Bach, circa  From the picture by Haussmann.]', '   Johann Sebastian Bach, circa  From the picture by Haussmann.CHAPTER III. BACH AS A CLAVIER PLAYER', " As a Clavier player Bach was admired by all who had the good fortune to hear him and was the envy of the virtuosi of his day.  His method greatly differed from that of his contemporaries and predecessors, but so far no one has attempted to explain in what the difference consisted. The same piece of music played by ten different performers equally intelligent and competent will produce a different effect in each case.  Each player will emphasise this or that detail.  This or that note will stand out with differing emphasis, and the general effect will vary consequently.  And yet, if all the players are equally competent, ought not their performances to be uniform?  The fact that they are not so is due to difference of touch, a quality which to the Clavier stands as enunciation to human speech.  Distinctness is essential for the enunciation of vowels and consonants, and not less so for the articulation of a musical phrase. But there are gradations of distinctness.  If a sound is emitted indistinctly it is comprehensible only with effort, which occasions us to lose much of the pleasure we should otherwise experience. On the other hand, over-emphasis of words or notes is to be avoided.  Otherwise the hearer's attention will be diverted from the tout ensemble. To permit the general effect to be appreciated every note and every vowel must be sounded with balanced distinctness.", 'I have often wondered why Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach\'s Essay on the Right Manner of playing the Clavier does not elucidate the qualities that constitute a good touch.  For he possessed in high degree the technique that made his father pre-eminent as a player.  True, in his chapter on "Style in Performance," he writes, "Some persons play as if their fingers were glued together; their touch is so deliberate, and they keep the keys down too long; while others, attempting to avoid this defect, play too crisply, as if the keys burnt their fingers.  The right method lies between the two extremes." But it would have been more useful had he told us how to reach this middle path.  As he has not done so, I must try to make the matter as clear as is possible in words.', 'Bach placed his hand on the finger-board so that his fingers were bent and their extremities poised perpendicularly over the keys in a plane parallel to them. Consequently none of his fingers was remote from the note it was intended to strike, and was ready instantly to execute every command. Observe the consequences of this position.  First of all, the fingers cannot fall or (as so often happens) be thrown upon the notes, but are placed upon them in full control of the force they may be called on to exert.  In the second place, since the force communicated to the note needs to be maintained with uniform pressure, the finger should not be released perpendicularly from the key, but can be withdrawn gently and gradually towards the palm of the hand.  In the third place, when passing from one note to another, a sliding action instinctively instructs the next finger regarding the amount of force exerted by its predecessor, so that the tone is equally regulated and the notes are equally distinct.  In other words, the touch is neither too long nor too short, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel complains, but is just what it ought to be. Many advantages arise from holding the hand in Bach\'s position and from adopting his touch, on the Clavichord and Harpsichord, and on  the Organ as well. I point out merely the most important of them.   To begin with, if the fingers are bent, their movements are free.  The notes are struck without effort and with less risk of missing or hitting too hard, a frequent fault with people who play with their fingers elongated or insufficiently bent. In the second place, the sliding finger-tip, and the consequently rapid transmission of regulated force from one finger to another, tend to bring out each note clearly and to make every passage sound uniformly brilliant and distinct to the hearer without exertion.  In the third place, stroking the note with uniform pressure permits the string to vibrate freely, improves and prolongs the tone, and though the Clavichord is poor in quality, allows the player to sustain long notes upon it.  And the method has this advantage: it prevents over-expenditure of strength and excessive movement of the hand. We gather that the action of Bach\'s fingers was so slight as to be barely perceptible.  Only the top joint seemed to move. His hand preserved its rounded shape even in the most intricate passages. His fingers rested closely upon the keys, very much in the position required for a "shake."  An unemployed finger remained in a position of repose.  It is hardly necessary to say that that other limbs of his body took no part in his performance, as is the case with many whose hands lack the requisite agility.', 'A man may possess all these qualities, however, and remain an indifferent performer on the Clavier, just as clear and agreeable enunciation does not necessarily make a good speaker.  To be a first-rate performer many other qualities are needed, and Bach possessed them all in a notable degree.', 'Some fingers are longer and stronger than others. Hence players are frequently seduced to use the stronger whenever they can readily do so. Consequently successive notes become unequal in tone, and passages which leave no choice as to the finger to be used may become impossible to play. Bach recognised this fact very early in his career.  To get over the difficulty he invented exercises for his own use in which the fingers of both hands were made to practise passages in every conceivable position. By this means every finger on both hands equally became strong and serviceable, so that he could play a rapid succession of chords, single and double "shakes," and running passages with the utmost finish and delicacy, and was equally fluent in passages where some fingers play a "shake" while the others on the same hand continue the melody.', 'Besides these improvements, Bach invented a new system of fingering. Before his time, and even in his early years, it was usual for the player to pay attention to harmony rather than counterpoint. Even so it was not customary to use every one of the twenty-four major and minor keys.  The Clavichord was still what we term "gebunden"; that is, several keys struck the same string, which, therefore, could not be accurately tuned. Consequently it was usual to employ only those keys whose notes were tuned with some approximation to accuracy.  Again, good players in those days hardly ever used the thumb, except when a large interval had to be stretched.  But when Bach began to melodise harmony so that his middle parts not merely filled in but had a tune of their own, when, too, he began to deviate from the Church modes then in general vogue in secular music, using the diatonic and chromatic scales indifferently, and tuning the Clavier in all the twenty-four keys, he found himself compelled to introduce a system of fingering better adapted to his innovations than that in use, and in particular, to challenge the convention which condemned the thumb to inactivity. It is held by some writers that Couperin forestalled Bach\'s method of fingering, in his L\'Art de toucher le Clavecin, published in   But that is not the case.  In the first place, Bach was above thirty years old in 1716, and had already developed a distinctive method of his own.  And in the second place, Couperin\'s system differs materially from Bach\'s, though both made more frequent use of the thumb than was so far customary.  When I say "more frequent use" I do so advisedly; for whereas in Bach\'s system the thumb is the principal finger--for the difficult keys, as they are called, are unplayable without it--it is not equally indispensable with Couperin, whose thematic material was not so intricate as Bach\'s, nor did he compose or play in such difficult keys.  Consequently Couperin had not an equally urgent need to use the thumb. We need only compare Couperin\'s with Bach\'s system of fingering, as Carl Philipp Emmanuel explains it, to discover that Bach\'s permits every passage, however intricate and polyphonic, to be played with ease, whereas Couperin\'s is hardly effective even for his own compositions.  Bach was acquainted with Couperin\'s works and highly esteemed them, as he did those of other French Clavier composers, for their finish and brilliance. But he considered them affected in their excessive use of ornaments, scarcely a single note being free from them. He held them, also, superficial in matter.', 'Bach\'s easy, unconstrained use of the fingers, his musical touch, the clearness and precision of every note he struck, the resourcefulness of his fingering, his thorough training of every finger of both hands, the luxuriance of his thematic material and his original method of stating it, all contributed to give him almost unlimited power over his instrument, so easily did he surmount the difficulties of its keyboard.  Whether he improvised or played his compositions from notes, he systematically employed every finger of each hand, and his fingering was as uncommon as the compositions themselves, yet so accurate that he never missed a note. Moreover, he read at sight other people\'s compositions (which, to be sure, were much easier than his own) with the utmost facility.  Indeed, he once boasted to a friend at Weimar that he could play at sight and without a mistake anything put before him.  But he was mistaken, as his friend convinced him before the week was out.  Having invited Bach to breakfast one morning, he placed on the Clavier, among other music, a piece which, at a first glance, seemed perfectly easy.  On his arrival, Bach, as was his custom, sat down at the Clavier to play or look through the music. Meanwhile his friend was in the next room preparing breakfast.  In a short time Bach took up the piece of music destined to change his opinion and began to play it.  He had not proceeded far before he came to a passage at which he stopped.  After a look at it he began again, only to stop at the same place. "No," he called out to his friend, who was laughing heartily in the next room, "the man does not exist who can play everything at sight.  It can\'t be done." With that he got up from the Clavier in some annoyance.', 'Bach also could read scores with remarkable facility and play them on the Clavier. He found no more difficulty in piecing together the separate parts when laid side by side before him. He often did so when a friend brought him a new Trio or Quartet for Strings and wished to hear how it sounded.  If a Continuo part, however badly figured, was put before him he could improvise a Trio or Quartet upon it.  Nay, when he was in the mood and at the height of his powers, he would convert a Trio into a Quartet by extemporising a fourth part.  On such occasions he used a Harpsichord with two manuals and pedal attachment.', 'Bach preferred the Clavichord to the Harpsichord, which, though susceptible of great variety of tone, seemed to him lacking in soul.  The Pianoforte was still in its infancy and too coarse. Both for practice and intimate use he regarded the Clavichord as the best instrument and preferred to express on it his finest thoughts.  He held the Harpsichord, or Clavicembalo, incapable of the gradations of tone obtainable on the Clavichord, an instrument which, though feeble in quality, is extremely flexible.', "No one could adjust the quill plectrums of his Harpsichord to Bach's satisfaction; he always did it himself.  He tuned his Harpsichord and Clavichord, and was so skilful in the operation that it never took him more than a quarter of an hour.  It enabled him to play in any key he preferred, and placed the whole twenty-four of them at his disposal, so that he could modulate into the remoter as easily and naturally as into the more nearly related keys.  Those who heard him frequently could hardly detect the fact that he had modulated into a distant key, so smooth were his transitions.  In chromatic movements his modulation was as easy and sequent as in diatonic.  His Chromatic Fantasia, which is now published, bears out my statement.  In his extemporisation he was even freer, more brilliant and expressive.", 'When he played his own music Bach usually adopted a brisk pace.  He contrived to introduce so much variety that every piece became a sort of conversation between its parts.  If he wished to express deep emotion he did not strike the notes with great force, as many do, but expressed his feeling in simple melodic and harmonic figures, relying rather on the internal resources of his art than external dynamics.  Therein he was right. True emotion is not suggested by hammering the Clavier. All that results is that the notes cannot be heard distinctly, much less be connected coherently.CHAPTER IV.  BACH THE ORGANIST', " What has been said regarding Bach's admirable Clavier playing applies generally to his skill as an organist.  The Clavier and Organ have points in common, but in style and touch are as different as their respective uses.  What sounds well on the Clavier is ineffective on the Organ, and vice versa.  The most accomplished Clavier player may be, and usually is, a bad organist unless he realises the differing natures of the two instruments and the uses they serve.  I have come across only two men who can be regarded as exceptions to this general rule--Bach and his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann.  Both were finished Clavier performers, but no trace of the Clavier style was apparent when they played the Organ. Melody, harmony, and pace were carefully selected with due regard to the nature and distinctive use of each instrument.  When Wilhelm Friedemann played the Clavier his touch was elegant, delicate, agreeable.  When he played the Organ he inspired a feeling of reverent awe. On the one he was charming.  On the other he was solemn, impressive. So also was his father, and to an even greater degree.  Wilhelm Friedemann was a mere child to him as an organist, and frankly admitted the fact. The music that extraordinary man wrote for the Organ is full of dignity, awe-inspiring, saturated with the atmosphere of devotion.  His improvisation was even more inspired, dignified, and impressive: for then his imagination was untrammelled by the irksomeness of expressing himself on paper.  What is the essence of this art? Let me, though imperfectly, attempt an answer.", "When we compare Bach's Clavier compositions with those written for the Organ it is at once apparent that they differ essentially in melodic and harmonic structure.  Hence we conclude that a good organist must select fitting themes for his instrument, and let himself be guided by its character and that of the place in which it stands and by the objects of its use.  Its great body of tone renders the Organ ill-adapted to light and jaunty music.  Its echoes must have liberty to rise and fall in the dim spaces of the church, otherwise the sound becomes confused, blurred, and unintelligible.  What is played upon it must be suited to the place and the instrument, in other words, must be congruous to a solemn and majestic fabric.  Occasionally and exceptionally a solo stop may be used in a Trio, etc.  But the proper function of the Organ is to support church singing and to stimulate devotional feeling.  The composer therefore must not write music for it which is congruous to secular surroundings.  What is commonplace and trite can neither impress the hearer nor excite devotional feeling.  It must therefore be banished from the Organ-loft. How clearly Bach grasped that fact!  Even his secular music disdained trivialities.  Much more so his Organ music, in which he seems to soar as a spirit above this mortal planet.", "Of the means by which Bach attained to such an altitude as a composer for the Organ we may notice his harmonic treatment of the old Church modes, his use of the obbligato pedal, and his original registration.  The remoteness of the ecclesiastical modes from our twenty-four major and minor keys renders them particularly appropriate to the service of religion.  Any one who looks at Bach's simple four-part Hymn tunes (Choralgesänge) will at once convince himself of the fact.  But no one can realise how the Organ sounds under a similar system of harmonic treatment unless he has heard it.  It becomes a choir of four or five parts, each in its natural compass.  Compare the following chords in divided harmony:    [Divided Harmony, Bach treatment]", 'with these:[Divided Harmony, conventional treatment]', 'which is the more usual form organists employ. We realise instantly the effect when music in four or more parts is played in the same manner. Bach always played the Organ so, adding the obbligato pedal, which few organists know how to use properly.  He employed it not only to sound the low notes which organists usually play with the left hand, but he gave it a regular part of its own, often so complicated that many organists would find it difficult to play with their five fingers.', 'To these qualities must be added the exquisite art Bach displayed in combining the stops of the Organ.  His registration frequently astonished organists and Organ builders, who ridiculed it at first, but were obliged in the end to admit its admirable results and to confess that the Organ gained in richness and sonority.', 'Bach\'s peculiar registration was based on his intimate knowledge of Organ building and of the properties of each individual stop.  Very early in his career he made a point of giving to each part of the Organ the utterance best suited to its qualities, and this led him to seek unusual combinations of stops which otherwise would not have occurred to him. Nothing escaped his notice which had the slightest bearing on his art or promised to advance it.  For instance, he made a point of observing the effect of large musical compositions in different surroundings.  The practised ear, which enabled him to detect the slightest error in music even of the fullest and richest texture, and the art and rapidity with which he tuned his instrument, alike attest his intuitive skill and many-sidedness.  When he was at Berlin in 1747 he was shown the new Opera House.  He took in its good and bad qualities at a glance, whereas others had done so only after experience. He was shown the large adjoining Saloon and went up into the gallery that runs round it. Merely glancing at the roof he remarked, "The architect has secured a novel effect which, probably, neither himself nor any one else suspected." The Saloon, in fact, is a parallelogram. If a person puts his face to the wall in one corner of it and whispers a few words, another person at the corner diagonally opposite can hear them distinctly, though to others between them the words are inaudible.  The effect arises from the span of the arches in the roof, as Bach saw at a glance.  These and similar observations suggested to him striking and unusual combinations of Organ stops.', 'Bach brought the methods I have indicated to bear upon Church music, and they help to explain his extraordinarily dignified and inspired playing, which was at once so appropriate and filled the listener with deep awe and admiration.  His profound knowledge of harmony, unfailing originality, freedom from a secular style, his complete command of the instrument, both manuals and pedals, whence flowed a generous stream of the richest and most abundant fancy, the infallible and swift judgment which allowed him always to select from the treasury of his mind precisely the musical ideas best suited to the occasion immediately before him, his intuitive grasp of every detail, and his power to make it serve his artistic ends--in a word, his transcendent genius brought the art of Organ playing to a degree of perfection which, till then, it had never attained and hardly will attain again.  Quantz has expressed the same opinion. "The admirable Johann Sebastian Bach," he writes, "brought the art of Organ playing to its highest perfection.  It is to be hoped that when he dies it will not be suffered to decline or be lost, as is to be feared from the small number of people who nowadays bestow pains upon it."', 'Strangers often asked Bach to play to them between the hours of divine service.  On those occasions he was wont to select and treat a theme in various ways, making it the subject of each extemporisation even if he continued playing for two hours.  As a beginning he played a Prelude and Fugue on the Great Organ.  Then he developed it with solo stops in a Trio or Quartet.  A Hymn-tune followed, whose melody he interrupted in the subtlest fashion with fragments of the theme in three or four parts.  Last came a Fugue, with full Organ, in which he treated the subject alone or in association with one or more accessory themes. Here we have the art which old Reinken of Hamburg considered to be lost, but which, as he afterwards found, not only survived but attained its greatest perfection in Bach.', 'Bach\'s pre-eminent position and his high reputation often caused him to be invited to examine candidates for vacant organistships, and to report on new Organs.  In both cases he acted so conscientiously and impartially that he generally made enemies.  Scheibe, late Director of Music at the Danish Court, who as a young man was examined by Bach on such an occasion, was so incensed by Bach\'s unfavourable verdict that he afterwards avenged himself in his "Critical Musician" by violently attacking his examiner. In his examination of Organs Bach equally exposed himself to trouble.  He could as little prevail on himself to praise a bad instrument as to recommend a bad organist.  He was, therefore, severe, though always fair, in the tests he applied, and as he was thoroughly acquainted with the construction of the instrument it was hopeless to attempt to deceive him.  First of all he drew out all the stops, to hear the Full Organ.  He used to say jokingly, that he wanted to find out whether the instrument had good lungs!  Then he gave every part of it a most searching test.  But his sense of fairness was so strong that, if he found the work really well done, and the builder\'s remuneration too small, so that he was likely to be a loser, Bach endeavoured, and often successfully, to procure for him an adequate addition to the purchase price.', 'When the examination was over, especially if the instrument pleased him, Bach liked to exhibit his splendid talent, both for his own pleasure and the gratification of those who were present.  Such demonstrations of his powers invariably invited the verdict, that he was conclusively "the prince of Clavier and Organ players," a title which Sorge, the late highly-esteemed organist at Lobenstein, once gave him in a dedicatory Preface.CHAPTER V. BACH THE COMPOSER', " Bach's first attempts at composition, like all early efforts, were unsatisfactory.  Lacking special instruction to direct him towards his goal, he was compelled to do what he could in his own way, like others who have set out upon a career without a guide.  Most youthful composers let their fingers run riot up and down the keyboard, snatching handfuls of notes, assaulting the instrument in wild frenzy, in hope that something may result from it.  Such people are merely Finger Composers--in his riper years Bach used to call them Harpsichord Knights--that is to say, their fingers tell them what to write instead of being instructed by the brain what to play. Bach abandoned that method of composition when he observed that brilliant flourishes lead nowhere.  He realised that musical ideas need to be subordinated to a plan and that the young composer's first need is a model to instruct his efforts.  Opportunely Vivaldi's Concertos for the Violin, then recently published, gave him the guidance he needed.  He had often heard them praised as admirable works of art, and conceived the happy idea of arranging them for the Clavier. Hence he was led to study their structure, the musical ideas on which they are built, the variety of their modulations, and other characteristics. Moreover, in adapting to the Clavier ideas and phrases originally written for the Violin Bach was compelled to put his brain to work, and so freed his inspiration from dependence on his fingers.  Henceforth he was able to draw ideas out of his own storehouse, and having placed himself on the right road, needed only perseverance and hard work to succeed. And how persevering he was!  He even robbed himself of sleep to practise in the night what he had written during the day!  But the diligence he bestowed upon his own compositions did not hinder him from studying the works of Frescobaldi, Froberger, Kerl, Pachelbel, Fischer, Strungk, Buxtehude, Reinken, Bruhns, Böhm, and certain French organists who were famed in those days as masters of harmony and fugue.", "The models he selected--Church musicians for the most part--and his own disposition inclined him to serious and exalted subjects.  But in that kind of music little can be accomplished with inadequate technique. Bach's first object, therefore, was to develop his power of expressing himself before he attempted to realise the ideal that beckoned him.  Music to him was a language, and the composer a poet who, whatever the idiom he affects, must first of all have at his disposal the means of making himself intelligible to others. But the technique of his period Bach found limited in variety and insufficiently pliable.  Therefore he set himself at the outset to refashion the accepted harmonic system.  He did so in a manner characteristically individual and bearing the impress of his personality.", 'If the language of music is merely the utterance of a melodic line, a simple sequence of musical notes, it can justly be accused of poverty. The addition of a Bass puts it upon a harmonic foundation and clarifies it, but defines rather than gives it added richness.  A melody so accompanied--even though all the notes are not those of the true Bass--or treated with simple embellishments in the upper parts, or with simple chords, used to be called "homophony."  But it is a very different thing when two melodies are so interwoven that they converse together like two persons upon a footing of pleasant equality.  In the first case the accompaniment is subordinate, and serves merely to support the first or principal part.  In the second case the two parts are not similarly related.  New melodic combinations spring from their interweaving, out of which new forms of musical expression emerge.  If more parts are interwoven in the same free and independent manner, the apparatus of language is correspondingly enlarged, and becomes practically inexhaustible if, in addition, varieties of form and rhythm are introduced.  Hence harmony becomes no longer a mere accompaniment of melody, but rather a potent agency for augmenting the richness and expressiveness of musical conversation.  To serve that end a simple accompaniment will not suffice.  True harmony is the interweaving of several melodies, which emerge now in the upper, now in the middle, and now in the lower parts.', "From about the year 1720, when he was thirty-five, until his death in 1750, Bach's harmony consists in this melodic interweaving of independent melodies, so perfect in their union that each part seems to constitute the true melody. Herein Bach excels all the composers in the world. At least, I have found no one to equal him in music known to me.  Even in his four-part writing we can, not infrequently, leave out the upper and lower parts and still find the middle parts melodious and agreeable.", 'But in harmony of this kind each part must be highly plastic; otherwise it cannot play its role as an actual melody and at the same time combine with the other parts.  To produce it Bach followed a course of his own, upon which the textbooks of his day were silent, but which his genius suggested to him.  Its originality consists in the freedom of his part writing, in which he transgresses, seemingly, at any rate, rules long established and to his contemporaries almost sacred. Bach, however, realised their object, which was simply to facilitate the flow of pure melody on a sound harmonic basis, in other words, successive and coexistent euphony, and he succeeded with singular success though by unfamiliar means.  Let me explain my meaning more closely.', 'Between simple intervals there is little difficulty in deciding whether the second note must rise or fall.  And in regard to phrases, or sections of a phrase, if we analyse their structure and follow out their harmonic tendency, their resolution is equally clear.  But this sense of destination may be provoked in each part by different intervals.  As we have observed already, every one of the four parts must flow melodically and freely.  But to secure that result it will be necessary to introduce between the notes which begin a phrase and establish its general atmosphere other notes which often are not consonant with those employed in the other parts and whose incidence is governed by the accent.  This is what we call a transitus regularis et irregularis. Each part starts from a fixed point, and returns to it, but travels freely between them. No one has made more use of such progressions than Bach in order to colour his parts and give them a characteristic melodic line.  Hence, unless his music is played with perfect fluency, occasional passages will sound harshly and we may be tempted to accuse him of exaggeration.  But the charge is ill founded. Once we play them as Bach intended them, such passages reveal their full beauty and their attractive though bizarre dissonance opens up new vistas in the realm of sound.', "But, to speak in detail of Bach's transgression of recognised rules.  To begin with, he admitted octaves and fifths provided they sounded well; that is, when the cause of their being forbidden did not arise. Everybody knows that there are positions in which they sound well, and others when they should be avoided, owing to the harsh effect or thin harmony they produce.  Bach's octaves and fifths never produce bad or thin harmony, and he was very definite as to when they could and could not be used.  In certain circumstances he would not permit hidden fifths and octaves even between the middle parts, though we exclude them only between the outer parts.  Yet, on occasion he used them in such a barefaced manner as to puzzle the beginner in composition.  But their use very soon commends itself.  Even in the last revision of his early compositions we find him altering passages, which at first sight appear impeccable, with the object of enriching their harmony and without scrupling to use hidden octaves.  A remarkable instance occurs in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier, in the E major Fugue, between the fifth and fourth bars from the end. I regret to this hour that, on looking over the later text, from which Hoffmeister and Kühnel's edition of that work is printed, I was so foolish as to reject Bach's amended reading there, merely because the harmony is unorthodox though more pleasing.  I stupidly preferred the older, more correct, and harsher reading, though in the later text the three parts run easily and smoothly. And what more can one demand?", 'Again, there is a rule that every note raised by an accidental cannot be doubled in the chord, because the raised note must, from its nature, resolve on the note above.  If it is doubled, it must rise doubled in both parts and, consequently, form consecutive octaves.  Such is the rule.  But Bach frequently doubles not only notes accidentally raised elsewhere in the scale but actually the semitonium modi or leading-note itself.  Yet he avoids consecutive octaves.  His finest works yield examples of this.', 'Again, Bach\'s statement that "over a pedal point all intervals are permissible that occur in the three scales" should be regarded rather an expansion than a violation of the recognised rule.  In general what is called an Organ point is merely a retarded close.  Bach, however, did not hesitate to employ it in the middle of a piece; a striking example occurs in the last Gigue of the English Suites. On a first hearing this Gigue, imperfectly rendered, may not sound well.  But it grows more beautiful as it becomes more familiar, and what seemed harsh is found to be smooth and agreeable, until one never tires of playing and hearing it.', "Bach's modulation was as original and characteristic as his harmony, and as closely related to it.  But the two things, though closely associated, are not the same.  By harmony we mean the concordance of several parts; by modulation, their progression through keys.  Modulation can take place in a single part.  Harmony requires more than one.  I will endeavour to make my meaning clearer.", 'Most composers stick closely to their tonic key and modulate out of it with deliberation.  In music that requires a large number of performers, and in a building, for instance a church, where the large volume of sound dies away slowly, such a habit shows good sense in the composer who wishes his work to produce the best possible effect.  But in chamber or instrumental music it is not always a proof of wisdom, but rather of mental poverty. Bach saw clearly that the two styles demand different treatment.  In his large choral compositions he bridles his exuberant fancy.  In his instrumental works he lets himself go.  As he never courted popularity, but always pursued his ideal, Bach had no reason to suppress the nobility of his inspirations, or to lower their standard for public consumption.  Nor did he ever do so.  Therefore every modulation in his instrumental work is a new thought, a constantly progressive creation in the plane of the chosen keys and those related to them.  He holds fast to the essentials of harmony, but with every modulation introduces a new suggestion and glides so smoothly to the end of a piece that no creaking of machinery is perceptible; yet no single bar--I might almost say no part of a bar--is like another.  Every modulation bears a strict relationship to the key from which it proceeds, and springs naturally from it.  Bach ignored, or rather despised, the sudden sallies by which many composers seek to surprise their hearers.  Even in his chromatic passages his progressions are so smooth and easy that we are hardly conscious of them, however extreme they may be.  He makes us feel that he has not stepped outside the diatonic scale, so quick is he to seize upon the consonances common to dissonant systems and combine them to his sure purpose.[The Bach Statue at Eisenach] The Bach Statue at EisenachCHAPTER VI. BACH THE COMPOSER (CONTINUED)', ' Bach\'s treatment of harmony and modulation powerfully influenced his melody.  The strands of his harmony are really concurrent melodies. They flow easily and expressively, never engross the hearer\'s attention, but divide his interest, as now one now the other becomes prominent. Even when they are noticeable they seem obscured by the melodic parts that accompany them--I say "seem obscured," for if the hearer is sufficiently instructed to distinguish the several melodies in the ensemble he will discover them to be more clearly defined by their accompaniment.', "The combination of several melodic lines obliges the composer to use devices which are unnecessary in homophonic music.  A single melody can develop as it pleases.  But when two or more are combined each must be so delicately and cleverly fashioned that it can be interwoven with the others in this direction and in that.  And here we detect one at least of the reasons why Bach's melodies are so strangely original, and his tunes so clearly distinguishable from those of other composers.  Provided that novelty does not degenerate into eccentricity or extravagance, and that clearness and facility of expression march with agreeableness, a composer's meritoriousness is proclaimed in his originality. The one drawback is that the ordinary hearer cannot appreciate melodic beauties which are patent only to the expert.", "But Bach's melodies are not invariably so handicapped. They are always original, it is true. But in his free compositions the melodies are so natural and spontaneous that, while they sound differently from those of other composers, their naturalness, and the sincerity of feeling that inspires them, make them intelligible to every listener.  Most of the Preludes in the Well-tempered Clavier as well as a number of movements in the Suites are of this character.", "Bach's melody, then, bears the unmistakable stamp of originality.  And so does his passage work, as it is called.  Such novelty, originality, and brilliancy are not found in any other composer. Examples are to be found in all Bach's Clavier works. But the most striking and original are in the Great Variations, in the first Part of the Clavierübung, in the English Suites, and the Chromatic Fantasia. In the last particularly Bach's fertility impresses us.  The greater part of its passage work is in the form of harmonic arpeggios whose richness and originality match the chords they represent.", "In order to realise the care and skill Bach expended on his melody and harmony, and how he put the very best of his genius into his work, I need only instance his efforts to construct a composition incapable of being harmonised with another melodic part.  In his day it was regarded as imperative to perfect the harmonic structure of part-writing. Consequently the composer was careful to complete his chords and leave no door open for another part.  So far the rule had been followed more or less closely in music for two, three, and four parts, and Bach observed it in such cases.  But he applied it also to compositions consisting of a single part, and to a deliberate experiment in this form we owe the six Violin and the six Violoncello Solo Suites, which have no accompaniment and do not require one.  So remarkable is Bach's skill that the solo instrument actually produces all the notes required for complete harmony, rendering a second part unnecessary and even impossible.", 'Bach\'s melody never palls on us, because of the presence in it of those qualities to which I have referred.  It remains "ever fair and young," like Nature herself.  In his earlier works, in which we find him still in bondage to the prevailing mode, there is a good deal that to-day seems antiquated.  But when, as in his later works, he draws his melody from the living wells of inspiration and cuts himself adrift from convention, all is as fresh and new as if it had been written yesterday.  Of how many compositions of that period can the same be said?  Even the works of ingenious composers like Reinhard Keiser and Handel have become old-fashioned sooner than we or their composers might have supposed. Like other caterers for the public, they were obliged to pander to its taste, and such music endures no longer than the standard which produced it. Nothing is more inconstant and fickle than popular caprice and, in general, what is called fashion.  It must be admitted, however, that Handel\'s Fugues are not yet out of date, though there are probably few of his Arias that we now find agreeable.', 'Bach\'s melody and harmony are rendered still more distinctive by their inexhaustible rhythmic variety.  Hitherto we have discussed his music merely subjectively as harmony and melody.  But to display vivacity and variety music needs to be uttered with rhythmic point and vigour.  More than those of any other period composers of Bach\'s time found no difficulty in this, for they acquired facility in the management of rhythm in the "Suite," which held the place of our "Sonata." Between the initial Prelude and closing Gigue the Suite includes a number of characteristic French dance measures, whose rhythm is their distinguishing characteristic.  Composers of Bach\'s day, therefore, were familiar with measures and rhythms which are now obsolete.  Moreover skilful treatment was necessary in order that each dance might exhibit its own distinctive character and swing.  Herein Bach exceeded his predecessors and contemporaries.  He experimented with every kind of key and rhythm in order to give variety and colour to each movement.  Out of his experience he acquired such facility that, even in Fugue, with its complex interweaving of several parts, he was able to employ a rhythm as easy as it was striking, as characteristic as it was sustained from beginning to end, as natural as a simple Minuet.', "The source of Bach's astonishing pre-eminence is to be sought in his facile and constant application of the methods we have discussed.  In whatever form he chose to express himself, easy or difficult, he was successful and seemingly effortless. There is not a note in his music that does not suggest consummate ease of workmanship. What he sets out to do he concludes triumphantly. The result is complete and perfect; no one could wish for a single note to be other than it is.  Some illustrations will make my point clearer.", 'Carl Philipp Emmanuel, in the preface to his father\'s Vierstimmige Choralgesänge ("Four-part Hymn-tunes"), which he edited, says that the world was accustomed to look for nothing but masterpieces from Bach. Some reviewers thought this praise exaggerated.  But if the term "masterpiece" is restricted to works written during the years of Bach\'s maturity it is nothing less than the truth.  Others have produced masterpieces in various forms which may be placed honourably by the side of his.  For instance, certain Allemandes, Courantes, etc., by Handel and others are not less beautiful, though less richly wrought, than Bach\'s. But in Fugue, Counterpoint, and Canon he stands alone, in a grandeur so isolated that all around him seems desert and void.  No one ever wrote Fugues to compare with his; indeed, persons unacquainted with them cannot imagine what a Fugue is and ought to be.  The ordinary Fugue follows a rule of thumb development.  It takes a theme, puts another beside it, passes them into related keys, and writes other parts round them over a Continuo.  Certainly this is Fugue: but of what merit?  Persons who know no other not unnaturally hold the whole species in little esteem, and the player who hopes to make such commonplace material convincing will need all his skill and imagination.', "Bach's Fugue is of quite another kind.  It presents all the characteristics we are accustomed to in freer musical forms: a flowing and distinctive melody, ease, clarity, and facility in the progression of the parts, inexhaustible variety of modulation, purest harmony, the exclusion of every jarring or unnecessary note, unity of form and variety of style, rhythm, and measure, and such superabundant animation that the hearer may well ask himself whether every note is not actually alive.  Such are the properties of Bach's Fugues, properties which excite the admiration and astonishment of all who can appreciate the intellectual calibre their composition demands. How great a tribute of homage is due to work of this kind, which exhibits all the qualities which lend distinction to compositions in other musical forms!  Moreover, while all Bach's Fugues of his mature period have the foregoing properties in common, each is endowed with peculiar excellencies of its own, has its own distinctive individuality, and displays a melodic and harmonic scheme in keeping with it.  The man who can play one of Bach's Fugues is familiar with, and can play, one only; whereas knowing one, we can perform portfolios of Fugues by other performers of Bach's period.", "To what a height was the art of Counterpoint carried by Bach's genius!  It enabled him to develop out of a given subject a whole family of related and contrasted themes, of every form and design.  It taught him to develop an idea logically from the beginning to the end.  It gave him such a command of harmony and its infinite combinations that he could invert whole themes, note by note, in every part, without impairing in the least the flow of melody or purity of his harmony.  It taught him to write in canon at all intervals and in movements of all kinds so easily and naturally that the workmanship is not perceptible and the composition sounds as smoothly as though it were in the free style. Lastly, it has given to posterity a legacy of works immensely various, which are, and will remain, models of contrapuntal form as long as music endures.", "I have written exclusively so far of Bach's Clavier and Organ work.  But in its expression music has two branches, instrumental and vocal, and as Bach excels in both of them, the reader will desire to hear somewhat respecting his vocal writings.", 'It was at Weimar that Bach first had occasion to write for the voice, upon his appointment to the Kapelle, which imposed on him the provision of music for the ducal chapel.  His church music, like his Organ works, is devout and serious, and in every respect what church music ought to be. He makes a point also of not elaborating individual words, which leads to mere trifling, but interprets the text as a whole. His choruses invariably are magnificent and impressive, and he frequently introduces Chorals into them, making the other parts accompany their Cantus fugally, as was the practice in a Motet.  As elsewhere in his works, the harmonic structure of his voice parts and instrumental accompaniment is rich.  The declamation of the recitatives is expressive, and the latter have fine Continuo parts. In his Arias, hardly one of which is not beautiful and expressive, Bach seems to have been handicapped by the inefficiency of his singers and instrumentalists, who constantly complained of the difficulty of his music.  If he had been fortunate enough to have capable performers the merits of his church music would have been established and, like his other works, they would still be sung and admired; for they contain treasures which deserve immortality.', "Among the works composed at Leipzig I single out two Cantatas, one of which was performed at Cöthen at the funeral of Bach's beloved Prince Leopold, and the other in St. Paul's Church, Leipzig, on the occasion of the funeral sermon in honour of Christiana Eberhardine, Queen of Poland and Electress of Saxony. The first contains double choruses of uncommon magnificence and most affecting sentiment. The second has only four-part choruses, but they are so delightful and fresh that he who begins the work will not pause till he has reached the end of it. It was written in October ", "Bach also composed a great number of Cantatas, chiefly for the choir of St. Thomas' School, Leipzig. The choir ordinarily numbered fifty singers, and sometimes more, over whose musical training Bach presided like a father.  He practised them so hard in Cantatas for single and double chorus that they became excellent singers.  Among these works are some which, in profundity of conception, magnificence, richness of harmony and melody, and animation, surpass everything of their kind. But, like all Bach's works, and in common with other masterpieces, they are difficult to perform and need a numerous orchestra to produce their full effect.", "Such are Bach's most important vocal compositions.  In minor forms of the art, morceaux for social entertainments and the like, he wrote little, though he was of a most sociable disposition. For instance, he is said never to have composed a song. And why should he?  They produce themselves so spontaneously that there is little call for genius to aid their gestation.", '  [Johann Sebastian Bach. From the picture discovered by Professor Fritz    Volbach]', '  Johann Sebastian Bach. From the picture discovered by Professor Fritz    VolbachCHAPTER VII. BACH AS A TEACHER', ' It not infrequently happens that talented composers and players are incapable of imparting their skill to others.  Either they have never troubled to probe the mechanism of their own facility, or, through the excellence of their instructors, have taken the short cut to proficiency and allowed their teacher and not their own judgment to decide how a thing should be done.  Such people are useless to instruct beginners.  True, they may succeed in teaching the rudiments of technique, assuming that they have been properly taught themselves.  But they are certainly unqualified to teach in the full sense of the word.  There is, in fact, only one way to become a good teacher, and that is to have gone through the discipline of self-instruction, a path along which the beginner may go astray a thousand times before attaining to perfection. For it is just this stumbling effort that reveals the dimensions of the art. The man who has adventured it learns the obstacles that obstruct his path, and how to surmount them. To be sure, it is a lengthy method. But if a man has patience to persevere he will reap a sure reward after an alluring pilgrimage.  No musician ever founded a school of his own who has not followed such a course, and to his experience his teaching has owed its distinctive character.', 'This is so with Bach, who, only gradually discovering his full stature, was thirty years old before unremitting application raised him above the difficulties of his art.  But he reaped his reward.  Self-discipline set him on the fairest and most alluring path that it has ever been given to a musician to tread.', 'To teach well a man needs to have a full mind. He must have discovered how to meet and have overcome the obstacles in his own path before he can be successful in teaching others how to avoid them.  Bach united both qualities.  Hence, as a teacher he was the most instructive, clear, and definite that has ever been.  In every branch of his art he produced a band of pupils who followed in his footsteps, without, however, equalling his achievement.', 'First of all let me show how he taught the Clavier. To begin with, his pupils were made to acquire the special touch of which I have already spoken. To that end for months together he made them practise nothing but simple exercises for the fingers of both hands, at the same time emphasising the need for clearness and distinctness. He kept them at these exercises for from six to twelve months, unless he found his pupils losing heart, in which case he so far met them as to write short studies which incorporated a particular exercise.  Of this kind are the Six Little Preludes for Beginners, and the Fifteen Two-part Inventions, both of which Bach wrote during the lesson for a particular pupil and afterwards improved into beautiful and expressive compositions.  Besides this finger practice, either in regular exercises or in pieces composed for the purpose, Bach introduced his pupils to the use of the various ornaments in both hands.', 'Not until this stage was reached did Bach allow his pupils to practise his own larger works, so admirably calculated, as he knew, to develop their powers.  In order to lessen their difficulty, it was his excellent habit to play over to them the pieces they were to study, with the remark, "That\'s how it ought to sound." It would be difficult to exaggerate the helpfulness of this method. The pupil\'s interest was roused by hearing the piece properly played. But that was not the sole result.  Without the help thus given the pupil could only hope to overcome the difficulties of the piece after considerable effort, and would find it much less easy to realise a proper rendering of it.  As it was, he received at once an ideal to aim at and was taught how to surmount the difficulties the piece presented.  Many a young performer, still imperfect after a year\'s practice, probably would master his music in a month if he once had it played over to him.', "Bach's method of teaching composition was equally sure and effective. He did not begin with the dry details of counterpoint, as was the custom of other teachers in his day.  Still less did he burden his pupils with the physical properties of sound, which he held to be matter for the theorist and instrument-maker rather than the composer.  He started them off at once on four-part harmony over a figured Bass, making his pupils write each part on a separate stave in order to impress on them the need for accurate harmonic progression.  Then he passed to Hymn tunes, setting the Bass himself and making his pupils write the Tenor and Alto parts.  In time he let them write the Bass also.  He insisted on correct harmony and on each part having a real melodic line.  Every musician knows what models Bach has left us in this form.  The inner parts of his four-part Hymn-tunes are so smooth and melodious that often they might be taken for the melody.  He made his pupils aim at similar tunefulness, and until they showed a high standard of merit did not permit them to write compositions of their own.  Meanwhile he aimed at cultivating their feeling for pure harmony and for the order and connection of ideas and parts by familiarising them with the compositions of others.  Until they had acquired facility in those qualities he neither permitted them nor held them competent to put pen to paper.", 'Bach required his pupils in composition to work out their musical ideas mentally.  If any of them lacked this faculty he admonished him not to compose and discountenanced even his sons from attempting to write until they had first given evidence of genuine musical gifts.  Having completed their elementary study of harmony, Bach took his pupils on to the theory of Fugue, beginning with two-part writing.  In these and other exercises he insisted on the pupil composing away from the Clavier. Those who did otherwise he ridiculed as "Harpsichord Knights."  In the second place he required rigorous attention to each part and its relation to the concurrent parts, permitting none, not even an inner one, to break off before it had finished what it had to say.  He insisted upon a correct relation between each note and its predecessor.  If he came upon one whose derivation or destination was not perfectly clear he struck it out as faulty.  It is, indeed, a meticulous exactitude in each individual part that makes Bach\'s harmony really multiple melody.  Confused part-writing, where a note that belongs to the Tenor is given to the Alto, or vice versa, or the haphazard addition of extraneous parts to a chord which suddenly shows an increase of notes as if fallen from the sky, to vanish as suddenly as they came, are faults found neither in his own nor his pupils\' writing.  He regarded his musical parts as so many persons engaged in conversation. If there are three, each of them on occasion may be silent and listen to the others until it finds something relevant to say itself.  But if, at an interesting point of the conversation, an interloping voice intervened, Bach regarded it as an intruder and let his pupils understand that it could not be admitted.', "Notwithstanding his strictness on this point, Bach allowed his pupils considerable licence in other respects.  In their use of certain intervals, as in their treatment of harmony and melody, he let them experiment within the limits of their ability, taking care to discountenance ugliness and to insist on their giving appropriate expression to the character of the composition.  Beauty of expression, he postulated, was only attainable on a foundation of pure and accurate harmony.  Having experimented in every form himself, he liked to see his pupils equally adventurous. Earlier teachers of composition, for instance, Berardi, Buononcini, and Fux, did not allow such liberty. They were afraid to trust their pupils to encounter difficulties, and short-sightedly prevented them from learning how to overcome them.  Bach's system was wiser, for it took his pupils farther, since he did not limit their attention, as his predecessors did, to the harmonic structure, but extended it to the qualities that constitute good writing, namely, consistency of expression, variety of style, rhythm, and melody.  Those who would acquaint themselves with Bach's method of teaching composition will find it fully set forth in Kirnberger's Correct Art of Composition.", "As long as his pupils were under his instruction Bach did not allow them to study any but his own works and the classics.  The critical sense, which permits a man to distinguish good from bad, develops later than the aesthetic faculty and may be blunted and even destroyed by frequent contact with bad music.  The best way to instruct youth is to accustom it early to consort with the best models.  Time brings experience and an instructed judgment to confirm the pupil's early attraction to works of true art.", "Under this admirable method of teaching all Bach's pupils became distinguished musicians, some more so than others, according as they came early or late under his influence, and had opportunity and encouragement to perfect and apply the instruction they received from him.  His two eldest sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emmanuel, were his most distinguished pupils, not because he gave them better instruction than the rest, but because from their earliest youth they were brought up amid good music at home.  Even before they began their lessons they knew what was good.  On the other hand, others, before they became Bach's pupils, either had heard no good music or their taste had been already vitiated by contact with bad.  It at least attests the excellence of Bach's method that even his pupils thus handicapped took high rank in their profession and distinguished themselves in one or other of its branches.", "Bach's first pupil was JOHANN CASPAR VOGLER, who received instruction from him in his early days at Amstadt and Weimar and, on Bach's testimony, was an exceedingly able player.  He became organist, and later burgomaster, at Weimar, retaining his professional position.  Some Choral Preludes by him for a two-manualed Organ with pedals were engraved about ", "Other pupils of Bach who became famous were:   HOMILIUS, of Dresden.  He was not only an excellent organist but a distinguished composer of church music as well.  TRANSCHEL, of Dresden. He was a fine musician and performer on the Clavier. There exist in MS. six Polonaises by him which perhaps are superior to those of any composer but Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.  GOLDBERG, of Königsberg. He was a very finished player on the Clavier, but without any marked talent for composition.  KREBS, Organist at Altenburg. He was not only a player of the first rank, but also a prolific composer for the Organ, Clavier, and of church music. He was fortunate in having Bach's instruction for nine years.  ALTNIKOL, Organist at Naumburg.  He was Bach's son-in-law and is said to have been a very competent player and composer.  AGRICOLA, Court Composer at Berlin. He is less known as a composer than as a theorist. He translated Tosi's II canto figurato from Italian into German and provided the work with an instructive commentary.  MÜTHEL, of Riga.  He was a good Clavier player and wrote for that instrument.  His Sonatas and a Duet for two Claviers attest his ability as a composer.  KIRNBERGER, Court Musician at Berlin to the Princess Amalia of Prussia. He was one of the most distinguished of Bach's pupils, full of genuine enthusiasm for his art and eager to assure its interests.  Besides his exposition of Bach's system of teaching composition, we are indebted to him for the first logical treatise on harmony, in which he sets forth his master's teaching and practice.  The first work is entitled Kunst des reinen Satzes, and the second, Wahre Grundsätze zum Gebrauch der Harmonie. He served the interests of his art also by other writings and compositions, and was an excellent teacher. The Princess Amalia was his pupil.  KITTEL, Organist at Erfurt.  He is a sound, though not a finished, player, and is distinguished as a composer by several Organ Trios, so excellent that Bach himself might have written them. He is the sole survivor  of Bach's pupils.  VOIGT, of Anspach, and an organist named SCHUBART were mentioned to me by Carl Philipp Emmanuel as having been Bach's pupils.  He knew nothing about them except that they entered his father's house after he left it.", "I have said already that Bach's sons were his most distinguished pupils. The eldest, WILHELM FRIEDEMANN BACH, came nearest to his father in the originality of his genius.  His melodies have quite a different character from those of other composers.  They are exceedingly clever, elegant, and spontaneous.  When performed with delicacy, as he played them, they cannot fail to charm every hearer.  It is greatly to be regretted that he preferred to follow his fancy in extemporisation and to expend his genius on fugitive thoughts rather than to work them out on paper.  The number of his compositions therefore is small, but all are beautiful.", 'CARL PHILIPP EMMANUEL BACH, who comes next, went out into the world sufficiently early to discover that it is a good thing for a composer to have a large public behind him.  Hence, in the clearness and easy intelligibility of his compositions, he approaches the popular style, though he scrupulously avoids the commonplace. Both he and his elder brother admitted that they were driven to adopt a style of their own by the wish to avoid comparison with their incomparable father.', "JOHANN CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH BACH, Concertmeister at the Court of Bückeburg, imitated Carl Philipp's style, but was not his equal. According to Wilhelm Friedemann, he was the best player among the brothers, and the most effective performer of their father's Clavier compositions.", 'JOHANN CHRISTIAN BACH, called "Bach of Milan," and afterwards "Bach of London," was the youngest son of Bach\'s second marriage and of too tender an age when his father died ever to have had lessons from him.  Hence, perhaps, the absence of Bach\'s style in his music.  He was, in fact, a popular composer universally admired in his day.CHAPTER VIII.  PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS', " Distinguished as a player, composer, and teacher, Bach was also an indulgent father, a good friend, and a loyal citizen.  His paternal devotion is shown by his care for his children's education, and he was equally assiduous in the performance of his civil and social duties.  His acquaintance was agreeable to everybody.  Every lover of music, whatever his nationality, was sure of a friendly reception at his house, and his sociability and reputation caused him to be seldom without visitors.", 'As an artist Bach was exceptionally modest. Notwithstanding his pre-eminence in his profession, a superiority of which he could not but be conscious, and in spite of the admiration and respect daily shown him, he never gave himself airs.  If he was asked the secret of his mastership he would answer, "I was made to work; if you are equally industrious you will be equally successful," a remark which made no allowance for his own exceptional genius.  His opinion of other composers and their work was invariably fair and generous.  Naturally, much of their work struck him as somewhat trivial, viewed from his own altitude.  But he never uttered a harsh criticism, unless it were to a pupil, to whom he held himself bound to say what he thought.  Still less did he presume on his acknowledged superiority to indulge in braggadocio, as often happens with performers brought into touch with those whom they regard as their inferiors.  Herein Bach\'s modesty went so far that he never spoke voluntarily of his frustrated contest with Marchand, though the latter was the challenger. Many absurd stories are told of Bach; for instance that, dressed up as a village schoolmaster, he liked to enter a church and ask the organist to let him play a Choral, in order to enjoy the astonishment excited by his playing, or to hear the Organist declare, "This must be Bach or the Devil." He always ridiculed such stories, and indeed had too much respect for his art to make it cloak his vanity.', "At musical parties where Quartet or other instrumental music was performed, Bach liked to play the Viola, an instrument which put him, as it were, in the middle of the harmony in a position from which he could hear and enjoy it on both sides.  On those occasions he would sometimes join in a Trio or other piece on the Harpsichord. If he was in the mood and the composer was agreeable, he would, as has been told already, extemporise a new Trio from the Continuo part, or, adding a new part, convert the Trio into a Quartet. But these were the only occasions on which he was ready to display his great powers before others.  One Hurlebusch, of Brunswick, a conceited and arrogant Clavier player, once visited Bach at Leipzig, not to hear him play, but to play to him. Bach received him politely and listened patiently to his very indifferent performance. On taking leave Hurlebusch made Bach's eldest sons a present of his published Sonatas, exhorting them to study them diligently. Bach, knowing the kind of music his sons were wont to play, smiled at Hurlebusch's naïveté but did not permit him to suspect his amusement.", "Bach was fond of listening to the music of other composers. If he and one of his elder sons happened to be in church when a Fugue was played, directly the subject had been stated he always pointed out how it ought to be developed.  If the composer knew his business and fulfilled Bach's anticipations, he was pleased and nudged his son to draw his attention to the fact.  Is this not evidence of his impartial interest in other people's compositions?", "I have mentioned already the composers whom in his youth Bach esteemed, loved, and studied. Later, when experience ripened his critical faculty, he had other favourites, among them Imperial Kapellmeister Fux, Handel, Caldara, Reinhard Keiser, Hasse, the two Grauns, Telemann, Zelenka, Benda, etc., and, in general, the distinguished musicians at Dresden and Berlin.  He was acquainted with all except the first four of those I mention.  In his youth Bach was intimate with Telemann. He also had a very warm regard for Handel and often expressed a desire to know him.  As Handel, like himself, was a famous performer on the Organ and Clavier, many in Leipzig and its neighbourhood wished to bring the two great men together.  But Handel, then living in London, never found time for a meeting during the visits he paid to Halle, his native town.  On his first visit in 1719, Bach was at Cöthen, only some twenty miles distant.  As soon as he was informed of Handel's arrival he lost not a moment in setting out to visit him, but on his arrival found that Handel had returned to England.  At the time of Handel's second visit, between 1730 and 1740, Bach was prevented from leaving Leipzig by indisposition.  But no sooner was he advised of Handel's arrival at Halle than he sent his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, to beg him to visit Leipzig, an invitation which Handel was unable to accept.  In 1752 or 1753, when Handel paid his third visit to Germany, Bach was dead. He had always expressed the strongest desire to know Handel, and the Leipzig people were disappointed in their wish to hear the two great men together.", 'While Hasse was Kapellmeister at Dresden both the Opera and Kapelle flourished.  Bach had many friends at Dresden, who held him in high regard.  Among them may be mentioned Hasse and his wife, the celebrated Faustina. They often visited Leipzig and were admirers of the Cantor\'s rare talents.  Hence, at Dresden he was always received in the most respectful manner and often visited the Opera, generally accompanied by his eldest son.  When the time for their journey approached Bach would say in fun, "Well, Friedemann, shall we go to Dresden to hear the pretty tunes again?" Innocent as the jest was, I am sure Bach would not have uttered it to any but his son, who already could distinguish between great music and agreeable trifles.', 'Bach was never in a position to make what is called a brilliant fortune. He held a fairly lucrative office, but his income had to maintain and educate a large family.  He neither possessed nor sought other means of livelihood, and was too absorbed in his art and work to think of accepting engagements which, in those days, and to a man of his genius, certainly would have brought riches. Had he possessed a taste for travel he would, as even one of his detractors admits, have "drawn upon himself the admiration of the whole world." But he preferred a quiet domestic life, constant occupation in his work, with contentment and a moderate competence, like his forbears. His modesty, however, did hot prevent him from receiving manifold proofs of regard and affection and marks of honourable distinction. Prince Leopold of Cöthen, Duke Ernst August of Weimar, and Duke Christian of Weissenfels, all showed sincere regard for him, which must have been the more agreeable to him seeing that they were all sound judges of music.  At Berlin, as at Dresden, he was universally honoured and respected. If we add to these testimonies the fact that he captured the admiration of all who heard him play or were acquainted with his music, then we may be sure that Bach, "singing for himself and the Muses," received at the hands of Fame the recognition he valued most, and cherished it far more than the trivial honour of a ribbon or gold chain.', 'I add that, in 1747, Bach became a member of the "Society of the Musical Sciences," founded by Mizler, only because we owe to the circumstance his admirable Choral Variations on Vom Himmel hoch. He presented them to the Society on his admission and they were engraved subsequently.CHAPTER IX. BACH\'S COMPOSITIONS', " To have produced so many great works in all forms of musical expression Bach necessarily must have been a prolific writer.  For if a composer be the greatest genius in the world, unless he constantly exercises his art he cannot hope to produce real masterpieces.  Superlative excellence is the fruit of indefatigable application.  Yet in Bach's case we should be wrong to acclaim as masterpieces all the products of his great activity just because masterpieces at length were the fruit of it.  Already in his early compositions we find undeniable evidence of genius.  But they are blemished by faults, passages poor in quality, extravagant, insipid, that are hardly worth preserving, though of interest to the student who wishes to trace from its source the development of Bach's genius.", "It is not difficult to distinguish with exactitude those of Bach's early compositions which are of the first excellence; for he has been at pains to give us the clue.  As he did not publish his first work until he was about forty years old  we are justified in assuming the merit of what, at so mature an age, he thought worthy to put into print, and in concluding generally that all his engraved works are of first-rate merit.", "With respect to his unpublished compositions, and they are by far the most numerous, we must in order to distinguish their merit rely partly on a critical examination of their texts, partly on Bach's own judgment.  Like all great composers, he was continually working on his compositions with a view to making them still more finished.  Indeed, he actually attempted to improve some of them that were already perfect.  Any that were susceptible of improvement he improved, even those already engraved.  Such is the origin of the variant readings of his works found in older and more recent texts.  By constantly retouching his compositions Bach aimed at making them indisputable masterpieces.  In this category I place most of what he wrote before the year 1725, as I show in detail in the following catalogue.  A great many compositions subsequent to 1725, which for reasons easily understood are still in MS., bear too evidently the stamp of perfection to leave us in doubt whether to class them as early essays or as the finished work of an accomplished master.", 'The following are those of Bach\'s works which have been engraved:   Clavierübung, or "Exercises for the Clavier, consisting of Preludes, Allemandes, Courantes, Sarabandes, Gigues, Minuets, etc., for the Diversion of Amateurs. Opus I. Published by the Composer, 1731."  This was Bach\'s first published work and contains six Suites.  The first of them came out in 1726; the others followed in successive years until all were engraved together in  The work was much noticed at the time.  Such compositions for the Clavier had not been seen or heard before, and the man who could play them was sure of a success.  Our young players to-day would profit by the study of them, so brilliant, agreeable, expressive, and original are they. In the new edition they are entitled, "Exercises for the Clavier."  Clavierübung, or "Exercises for the Clavier, Part II., consisting of a Concerto in the Italian style and an Overture in the French manner for a Clavier with two manuals.  Published by Christopher Weigel, Junior, in Nürnberg."  Clavierübung, or "Exercises for the Clavier, Part III., consisting of various Organ Preludes to the Catechism and other Hymns, composed for the diversion of amateurs and particularly of competent judges of such works.  Published by the Composer." Besides the Preludes and Fugues for the Organ, all of which are masterly, the book contains four Duetti for the Clavier, models of their kind.  Sechs Choräle, or "Six Choral Melodies of different kinds, for an Organ with two manuals and pedal.  Zella, in the Thuringian Forest.  Published by Johann G. Schübler." They are full of dignity and religious feeling.  In some of them, too, we have instances of Bach\'s original management of the stops. Thus, in the second Choral, Wo soll ich fliehen hin, he gives to the first manual an 8 foot, to the second a 16 foot, and to the pedal a 4 foot stop.  The pedal has the cantus firmus.  Clavierübung, or "Exercises for the Clavier, consisting of an Aria with several Variations, for a Clavier with two manuals. Published by Balthasar Schmidt at Nürnberg." This admirable work consists of thirty Variations, some in canon, in a variety of movements and at all intervals from the unison to the ninth, with easy flowing melody.  It includes a regular fourpart Fugue, several extremely brillant Variations for two Claviers, and concludes with a Quodlibet, as it is called, which alone would render its composer immortal, though it is not the best thing in the volume.  The Variations are models of what such compositions ought to be, though no one has been so rash as to attempt to follow Bach\'s footsteps. We owe them to Count Kaiserling, formerly Russian Ambassador at the Saxon Electoral Court, who frequently visited Leipzig with Goldberg, already mentioned among Bach\'s pupils. The Count was a great invalid and suffered from insomnia.  Goldberg lived in the Ambassador\'s house, and slept in an adjoining room, to be ready to play to him when he was wakeful.  One day the Count asked Bach to write for Goldberg some Clavier music of a soothing and cheerful character, that would relieve the tedium of sleepless nights.  Bach thought a set of Variations most likely to fulfil the Count\'s needs, though, on account of the recurrence of the same basic harmony throughout, it was a form to which he had hitherto paid little attention.  Like all his compositions at this period, however, the Variations are a masterpiece, and are the only example he has left us of this form. The Count always called them "my Variations" and was never weary of hearing them.  For long afterwards, when he could not sleep, he would say, "Play me one of my Variations, Goldberg." Perhaps Bach was never so well rewarded for any composition as for this.  The Count gave him a golden goblet containing one hundred louis d\'ors, though, as a work of art, Bach would not have been overpaid had the present been a thousand times as large.  It may be observed, that in the engraved copy of the Variations there are serious mistakes, which the composer has corrected in his own copy.   Einige kanonische Verdäderungen, "Canonic Variations on the Christmas Hymn \'Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her,\' for an Organ with two manuals and pedal. Published at Nürnberg by Balthasar Schmidt." The work contains five canonic variations of the utmost ingenuity.  Musikalisches Opfer, or "A Musical Offering," dedicated to Frederick II., King of Prussia.  The theme received by Bach from the King is treated first as a three-part Fugue under the acrostic title "Ricercare" (Regis iussu cantio et reliqua canonica arte resoluta). There follows a six-part "Ricercare" and Thematis regii elaborationes canonicae of various kinds. The work includes a Trio for Flute, Violin, and Clavier upon the same subject.  Die Kunst der Fuge, or "The Art of Fugue."  This work, unique of its kind, did not appear till about 1752, after Bach\'s death, though the greater part of it had been engraved by his sons during his lifetime. Marpurg, the leading German musical critic of that day, contributed a preface to this edition which contains many just observations on the value and utility of such treatises. But, being too good for the general public, the work found only a small circulation among those who discerned its merit and eagerly bought copies. The plates were never used again and eventually were sold by Bach\'s heirs at the price of old copper.  Written by a man of Bach\'s transcendent genius, and commended as a masterpiece by a critic so highly regarded as Marpurg, a work of this kind, if published in any other country than Germany, would have passed through at least ten editions by now, if only at the bidding of patriotism.  But in Germany not a sufficient number of copies was sold to pay for the plates used in engraving the work!  The work consists of fugal Variations planned on the most elaborate scale. The composer\'s intention was to show in what a variety of ways the same theme can be treated fugally.  The Variations (here called "Contrapunctus") are complete Fugues upon the same theme.  The last Fugue of all has three subjects, in the third of which the composer signs his name, B A C H. Bach was prevented from finishing it by the disorder of his eyes, and as an operation brought no relief the movement was never completed.  It is said that Bach intended to introduce four themes into it and to bring it to an impressive conclusion by inverting them all. All the Fugues in the work are equally smooth and melodious.  To make up for the unfinished Fugue Bach concluded the work with a Choral Prelude upon the tune "Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein," which he dictated to his son-in-law, Altnikol, a few days before his death. Of the extraordinary skill it displays I do not speak, save to remark that even in his last illness it proclaims Bach\'s skill undiminished.  The pious resignation and devotion that characterise it move me deeply whenever I play it.  Nor should I find it easy to say which I had rather had been omitted, the Choral Prelude, or the conclusion of the unfinished Fugue.   Lastly, after Bach\'s death, his four-part Chorals were collected by his son, Carl Philipp Emmanuel, and were published by Birnstiel (Berlin and Leipzig), Part I. in 1765, Part II. in  Each Part contains one hundred Chorals, mostly taken from the composer\'s church Cantatas.  More recently Kirnberger edited, in four volumes, a collection of Bach\'s Chorals. They are published by Breitkopf.  Bach\'s works, still in MS., consist of compositions for the Clavier, Organ, with and without other instruments, Strings, and the voice. I will enumerate them in that order.  I. Compositions For The Clavier    Six Little Preludes far Beginners.  Fifteen Two-part Inventions.  An Invention is a musical theme so constructed that by imitation and inversion a whole movement can be evolved from it.  The subject having been first stated, the rest develops naturally out of it.  For the instruction of a young Clavier player these fifteen Inventions are of great value, seeing that the composer has been careful not only to provide exercises for both hands but for every finger as well.  They were composed at Cöthen in 1723, with a long title which begins: "An honest Guide, in which lovers of the Clavier are shown a clear method of playing correctly in two parts," etc.  It cannot be denied that, among other blemishes, the Inventions occasionally exhibit melodic poverty and roughness.  But finding them useful to his pupils, Bach eventually revised them and removed from them everything that offended his maturer taste, so that they now stand as masterpieces of pure music.  Moreover they are invaluable exercises for the fingers and hands and are sound instructors of taste.  There is no better introduction to Bach\'s larger works than they afford.   Fifteen three-part Inventions, also called Symphonies.  They were written for the same purpose as the Inventions, but are more advanced.  The Well-tempered Clavier, or, Preludes and Fugues in all tones and semitones, composed for the profit and use of young musicians desirous of knowledge, as also for those who are skilled already in this studio.  Part I. was finished in   Part II., like Part I., contains twenty-four Preludes and twenty-four Fugues in every key, and was composed at a later period. Every number of it, from first to last, is a masterpiece.  In Part I., however, certain Preludes and Fugues bear marks of immaturity and are included probably only in order to complete the series.  But here again Bach eventually corrected whatever seemed to him lacking in finish.  He altered or rewrote entire passages, so that in the later texts few movements are not perfect.  Among these few I reckon the Fugues in A minor, G major and G minor, C major, F major and F minor. The rest are excellent, some of them so superlatively good as to be not inferior to those in Part II. Even Part II., for all its original perfection, has been improved by the composer, as may be observed by comparing the original and later texts.  Both Parts contain treasures of art not to be found outside Germany.  Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue. I have taken considerable pains to discover a similar piece of music by Bach, but without success.  The Fantasia is unique and unequalled.  Wilhelm Friedemann sent it to me from Brunswick inscribed with these words by a mutual friend. "Anbey kommt an etwas Musik von Sebastian, sonst genannt: Fantasia chromatica; bleibt schön in alle Saecula."  It is remarkable that this piece, for all its technical skill, appeals to the most unpractised hearer, if it is performed at all tolerably.   A Fantasia in C minor.  It is not of the same character as the preceding work, but resembles rather the Allegro of a Sonata.  It is divided into two parts, but must be played as a single movement.  It is an excellent work, and in old copies an unfinished Fugue follows, which, however, cannot belong to it. The first thirty bars certainly are by Bach, for they are marked by an extremely bold use of augmented and diminished intervals and their inversions, in three-part harmony.  None but Bach attempted such things. The rest of the movement seems to have been added by another hand and bears no trace of Bach\'s style.  Six large Suites, consisting of Preludes, Allemandes, Courantes, Sarabandes, etc.  They are known as the "English Suites," because the composer wrote them for an Englishman of rank.  All of them are of great merit as works of art, and some movements, in particular the Gigues of the fifth and sixth Suites, are perfect masterpieces of harmony and melody.  Six small Suites, consisting of Allemandes, Courantes, etc. They are generally called the "French Suites," because they are written in the French style. The composer is intentionally less academic in them than in his larger Suites, and their melodies are more than usually pleasant and agreeable.  In particular the fifth Suite deserves to be noticed: all its movements are most melodious, and in the concluding Gigue only consonant intervals, especially thirds and sixths, are used.', "These are Bach's principal works for the Clavier which can be considered classics. A great number of single Suites,Toccatas and Fugues, besides those already mentioned, have great and varying merit, but are youthful works. At the most, ten or twelve of them seem to me worth preserving, some of them because they would be useful as finger exercises, for which their author originally intended them, others because they are at least better than similar works by other composers. As an exercise for the fingers of both hands I particularly single out a Fugue in A minor, in which the composer has been at great pains to write florid passages in order to give equal strength and suppleness to both hands.  For beginners a little two-part Fugue should also prove useful.  It is melodious, flowing, and not at all old-fashioned.II. Music For The Clavier With Other Instruments    Six Sonatas for Clavier with Violin obbligato.  Composed at Cöthen, they are among Bach's masterpieces in this form and display fugal and canonic writing which is both natural and full of character.  The Violin part needs a master to play it; for Bach knew the capabilities of the instrument and spared it as little as the Clavier.  The six Sonatas are in the keys of B minor, A major, E major, C minor, F minor, and G major.  Several Sonatas for Harpsichord and Violin, Harpsichord and Flute, Harpsichord and Viol da Gamba. They are admirably written and most of them are pleasant to listen to even today.  Several Concertos for the Clavier and other instruments.  They contain real gems of art but are antiquated in form.  Two Concertos for two Claviers, with an accompaniment of two Violins, Viola, and Violoncello.  The first, in C minor, has an antique flavour. But the second, in C major, is as fresh as if it had been written yesterday. It may be played without the String quartet and still sounds admirable.  The final Allegro is a majestic movement and strictly fugal.  Compositions of this form were first perfected, indeed, we may conjecture, were first attempted, by Bach.  At least, I have met with only a single example by another composer that may perhaps be older--namely, Pachelbel of Nürnberg's Toccata, as he called it.  Pachelbel, however, was a contemporary of Bach and may have taken the idea from him.  However, his work is not worth considering.  One instrument merely repeats the other's phrases without being at all concertante.  It almost seems as if Bach at this period had made up his mind to discover what could be done with any number of parts. Having already written for a single solo instrument music which required no accompaniment, he next experimented in dividing his material between as large a number of solo instruments as possible.  Hence the Concertos for two Claviers were followed by  Two Concertos for three Claviers with an accompaniment of Strings. These Concertos present a remarkable characteristic: besides the concertante combination of three Claviers, the stringed instruments also have concertante parts distinct from the accompaniment.  It is difficult to realise the art involved in this achievement.  For, in spite of their technical skill, the two works are so delicate, full of character, and expressive, that the composer might be treating a simple melody (note particularly the Concerto in D minor).  Words are inadequate to express the admiration they arouse.  But Bach was not satisfied.  Hence he wrote  A Concerto for four Claviers and four stringed instruments. I cannot judge the effect of this composition, for I have never been able to get together the four instruments and four performers it requires.  But that it is admirably written can be seen from the parts.  III. Compositions For The Organ", ' The pedal is the distinctive feature of the Organ which places it above all other instruments, and gives it its magnificence, sonority, and majesty.  Deprive it of the pedal and you take from it the solemn and imposing tones which are its distinctive utterance, reducing it to the level of a "positiv," or Chamber-organ, an instrument relatively insignificant.', 'But an Organ equipped with a pedal must be able to employ it in its full compass, and both composer and organist must know the proper use of it.  No one excelled Bach in this knowledge.  Not only is his rich harmony and melody singularly adapted to the instrument, but he gave the pedal a part of its own, even in his early compositions.  Yet it was only gradually that he mastered its technique; for his Organ masterpieces belong to the period in which those for the Clavier began to be classics. His early and immature Organ works are widely dispersed; for as soon as a composer begins to be distinguished everybody is anxious to possess a specimen of his art.  Public curiosity, however, generally dies down long before a composer comes to maturity, particularly if his work is over the heads of the public.  And this seems to have been Bach\'s fortune. Consequently his mature Organ works are less familiar than his early efforts.  The latter, however, cannot possibly be admitted to a "correct and critical" edition of his works, and I mention here only those whose merit is as incontestable as that of the Clavier works enumerated in the preceding paragraphs.', "Bach's finest Organ music falls into three groups:   The Great Preludes and Fugues, with obbligato pedal.  Their number cannot be stated, but I believe it not to exceed a dozen. At least, after prolonged search I have not been able to collect more than that number. To these I must add a very clever and original Passacaglia, which, however, seems suitable rather for a two-manual Clavicembalo and pedal than for the Organ.  Preludes on Choral Melodies. It was at Arnstadt that Bach began to compose Variations on Choral melodies, under the title Partite diverse. Most of them can be played on the manuals alone. Those which I include here are an exception and require the obbligato pedal.  Their number may amount to one hundred.  I myself possess above seventy, and more survive elsewhere. No other Choral Preludes approach them in religious feeling, dignity, and sublimity of expression.  I cannot notice them individually; they are too numerous. Besides the larger, there is a great number of shorter and easier ones, particularly useful for young players. MSS. of them exist in considerable number.  Six Sonatas, or Trios, for two manuals and an obbligato pedal. Bach wrote them for his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, whom they helped to become the great performer he was when I knew him.  It is impossible to overpraise their beauty.  Bach composed them when he was in the full vigour of his powers, and they may be considered his chef d'oeuvre in this form. He also wrote other Organ Sonatas, the MSS. of which are in various collections.  They are fine compositions, though they do not equal the Six in merit. IV. Instrumental Music", " There are few instruments for which Bach did not write.  In his day it was usual to play a Concerto or instrumental Solo during the Communion office. Bach composed many of these pieces himself, and always with a view to their improving the technique of the player.  Most of them are lost.  But two important works of another kind survive and to some extent compensate us.  They are:   Six Solos for Violin, unaccompanied.  Six Solos for Violoncello, unaccompanied. The Violin Solos have long been considered by the finest players to be the best instructor for the instrument. The Violoncello Solos are equally effective.     V. Vocal Music    Five complete sets of church Cantatas for the Sundays and Festivals of the year.  Five compositions for Holy Week, one of which is for double chorus.  Several Oratorios, Masses, a Magnificat, settings of the Sanctus, compositions for birthdays and Saints' Days, funerals, marriages, and some Italian Cantatas.  Several Motets for single and double chorus.", "Most of these works are now dispersed.  The Church Cantatas were divided between his elder sons after their composer's death.  Wilhelm Friedemann had the larger share because, being organist at Halle, he could make use of them.  Later, circumstances compelled him to part with them gradually. I know of no other collection of Bach's larger choral works.  There exist, however, eight or ten Motets for double chorus, but they are dispersed in various hands. In the collection bequeathed by the Princess Amalia of Prussia to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium at Berlin there are some of Bach's vocal compositions.  Their number is not considerable, but among them are the following:   Twenty-one Church Cantatas. In one of them, set to the words, Schlage doch, gewünschte Stunde, the composer introduces a bell obbligato.  From that fact we may conclude that the Cantata was not composed in the period of Bach's maturity, for the use of bells is of doubtful taste.  Two Masses for five voices with instrumental accompaniment.  A Mass for double chorus, the first being accompanied by Strings and the second by wind instruments.  A Passion, for double Chorus, the text by Picander.  A Sanctus, for four voices and instrumental accompaniment.  A Motet, for four voices, Aus tiefer Noth schrei ich zu dir.  A Motet for five voices, Jesu, meine Freude.  Four Motets, for eight voices in double chorus:  (a) Fürchte dich nicht, ich bin dei dir. (b) Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit auf. (c) Komm, Jesu, komm. (d) Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied.   A detached four-part fugal chorus, Nimm was dein ist, und gehe hin.  A bucolic Cantata, with Recitatives, Aria, Duet, and Chorus.  A note is prefixed to it.  On the MS. of the last-named Cantata and of the Mass for double chorus (No. 3 supra) there is a note by Kirnberger analysing the skill and merit of the compositions.CHAPTER X.  BACH'S MANUSCRIPTS", " It has been remarked more than once that Bach, throughout his life, devoted much thought to the improvement of his compositions.  I have had frequent occasion to compare the original and subsequent texts of his works, and confess to have experienced both surprise and pleasure in observing his care to improve whatever he thought faulty, to make good better, and better perfect.  Nothing is more instructive than a collation of this kind, whether to the experienced musician or the instructed amateur.  I should like to see a supplement to the complete edition of Bach's works showing these variant readings. The collation would be in the highest degree instructive, and to attempt it is as appropriate to the works of the composer, a poet in sound, as to those of the poet in words.", "In Bach's early texts he often repeats a phrase to other words with some melodic variety, in a lower or even in the same octave.  In his riper experience he could not tolerate such poverty of workmanship, and cut out these passages remorselessly, without regard for the number and quality of the persons who had approved them in their original state.  There occur to me two good examples of this, the C major and C sharp minor Preludes in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier. Bach revised them so drastically as to cut them down by one-half, sacrificing passages that he thought redundant.", 'In other places Bach tends to be over-concise; he expresses an idea, but does not fully develop it.  The best illustration that occurs to me is the D minor Prelude in the second part of the Well-tempered Clavier.  I possess several texts of it.  In the oldest the first transposition of the theme in the Bass and several other details essential to a complete development of the idea are wanting.  A second MS. gives the theme to the Bass wherever the latter is in a key nearly related to that of the tonic. In a third MS. these addenda are developed more fully and are joined more skilfully.  But melodic details are present of doubtful relevance to the rest of the composition.  In a fourth MS. these disappear or are amended, so that, as we have it, the Prelude stands as one of the most beautiful and least faulty in the Well-tempered Clavier. Many people, no doubt, preferred the movement in its original form.  But Bach was not a man to be influenced by approbation or criticism.  He went on correcting until he satisfied himself.', 'In the early part of the seventeenth century it was the fashion in instrumental music to overload single notes with ornaments and add florid runs.  Lately it has become the fashion to do so in vocal music as well. That Bach shared this disposition may be inferred from certain pieces that he wrote in this style.  An instance is the Prelude in E minor in the first part of the Well-tempered Clavier.  But he soon returned to his natural better taste, and altered the movement to the form in which it is engraved.', "Every decade has its own style of melody, distinctive of itself and evanescent.  A composer must carefully avoid it if he hopes to be listened to by posterity.  In his young days even Bach ran upon this rock.  His early compositions for the Organ, and the two-part Inventions in their original form, are full of fiorituri such as the taste of his period approved.  His Organ compositions remain comparatively untouched, but the Inventions he closely revised.  The public will soon be able to compare them in their first and later forms, as the publishers, with admirable spirit, have resolved to discontinue the present edition and to send out to subscribers a revised one based on Bach's corrected text.", "Bach's processes of revision so far mentioned, however, merely correct faults of form, that is, diffuseness or incomplete development of a musical thought.  But Bach employed other methods which are less easy to describe because they are more subtle.  He often rivets the style and character of a piece by changing a single note, strictly correct grammatically and yet disagreeable to an artist such as himself.  Even commonplace passages he could convert into phrases of beauty by the addition or alteration of a single note.  Only the most sensitive taste and trained experience can decide in such cases, and Bach possessed both in the highest perfection.  He developed them to such a pitch, indeed, that his brain eventually rejected any idea which, in all its properties and relations, did not accord inevitably and naturally with the whole composition.  Consequently his later works display such consistency of merit that all of them seem to have been cast complete in a mould, so smooth, facile and abundant is the flow of his rich fancy.  It is on the highest summits of the art that harmony and melody find their ideal union, and as yet Bach dwells there in majestic isolation.CHAPTER XI. THE GENIUS OF BACH", " It is surely unnecessary to ask whether that artist is a genius who, in every form of his art, has produced masterpiece after masterpiece, of an originality which sets them above the achievements of all other ages, distinguished also by a wealth of originality and agreeableness that enslaves every hearer.  The most fertile fancy, invention inexhaustible, a judgment so nice as to reject intuitively every irrelevant and jarring detail, unerring ingenuity in employing the most delicate and minute resources of his art, along with an unrivalled technique--these qualities, whose expression demands the outpouring of a man's whole soul, are the signboards of genius.  The man who cannot find them in Bach's music either is not acquainted with it at all or knows it imperfectly.  One needs to be steeped in it thoroughly to appreciate the genius of its author.  For the greater the work the closer study is demanded for its apprehension.  The butterfly method, a sip here and there, is of little use.  But admirable as were the gifts Bach received from nature, he could never have become an accomplished genius had he not learned betimes to avoid the rocks on which many artists, some of them perhaps not less gifted than he, too often founder.  I will communicate to the reader some scattered thoughts on the subject and conclude this essay with an indication of the characteristics of Bach's genius.", 'Even the largest natural gifts, coupled with the strongest propensity for a particular art, offer no more than fruitful soil on which that art may thrive by patient cultivation.  Industry, the true begetter of every art and science, is an indispensable factor.  Not only does it enable genius to master technique, but it stimulates the critical and reflective faculties also.  The very ease with which genius acquires and applies the apparatus of musical composition frequently entices it to leap over root principles in its plunge into deeper waters, or to fly before its wings are grown.  In such a case, unless genius is guided back to neglected fundamentals and forced to build itself upon the great examples of the past, it will inevitably expend its treasure uselessly and never attain to its promised dimensions.  For it is an axiom, that real progress can never be made, nor the highest perfection be attained, if the foundations are insecure.  If arduous heights are to be achieved, the easier obstacles must first be approached and overcome.  Guided by his own inexperience no one ever can hope to become great.  He must profit by the practice and example of others.', "Bach did not founder on this rock.  His soaring genius attended an equally ardent industry which incessantly impelled him, whenever he found his own equipment insufficient, to seek guidance from others.  Vivaldi and his Concertos were the first from whom he sought counsel.  From them he turned to the principal Organ and Clavier composers of the period.  Nothing is more intellectually stimulating than counterpoint, and the composers Bach studied were distinguished by their mastery of it, as their fugal writing attests.  Hence Bach's diligent study and imitation of them pointed his taste and imagination to perceive wherein himself was lacking and what steps were needed to take him farther in his art.", 'A second rock upon which genius often comes to grief is the public\'s undiscriminating applause.  To be sure, I do not undervalue public approval or commend without reserve the remark of a Greek teacher to his pupil, "You performed badly, otherwise the audience would not have applauded you."  Yet it is none the less true that many artists are thrown off their balance by exaggerated and often unmerited plaudits, particularly in their early careers before they have acquired self-discipline and sound judgment.  The public merely asks for what it can understand, whereas the true artist ought to aim at an achievement which cannot be measured by popular standards.  How, then, can popular applause be reconciled with the true artist\'s aspirations towards the ideal?  Bach never sought applause, and held with Schiller: Kannst du nicht allen gefallen durch deine That und dein     Kunstwerk,     Mach\' es wenigen recht; vielen gefallen ist schlimm.', ' Like every true artist, Bach worked to please himself in his own way, obeying the summons of his own genius, choosing his own subjects, and finding satisfaction only in the approval of his own judgment.  He could count on the applause of all who understood good music, and never failed to receive it.  Under what other conditions can sound works of art emerge? The composer who debases his muse to the popular mood either lacks real genius or, having it, abuses it.  For to catch the ear of the public is not a difficult task and merely connotes an agreeable facility.  Composers of that class are like artisans who frankly fashion their goods to suit their market.  But Bach never condescended to such artifices.  The artist, in his judgment, is the dictator of public taste, not its slave.  If, as often happened, he was asked to write something simple for the Clavier he would answer, "I will do what I can."  He would choose an easy theme.  But when he began to develop it he always found so much to say that the piece soon became anything but simple.  If his attention was drawn to the fact, he would answer smilingly, "Practise it well and you will find it quite easy.  You have as many good fingers on each hand as I have."  Nor was he prompted in this by mere contradictoriness, but exhibited the true artist spirit.', "It was, in fact, the artist temperament that led Bach to make the great and sublime his goal.  For that reason his music is not merely agreeable, like other composers', but transports us to the regions of the ideal.  It does not arrest our attention momentarily but grips us the stronger the oftener we listen to it, so that after a thousand hearings its treasures are still unexhausted and yield fresh beauties to excite our wonder.  Even the beginner who knows but the A B C of his art warms with pleasure when he hears Bach's music and can open his ear and heart to it.  It was the true artist spirit, too, that guided Bach to unite majesty and grandeur of design with meticulous care for detail and the most refined elegance, characteristics which we rather seek, perhaps, in works whose object is merely to give pleasure.  Bach held strongly that if the strands are imperfect, the whole design is faulty.  His genius is sublime and impressive, and he never condescends to be frivolous even when he touches the lighter forms of art.", 'To conclude: it was the union of astounding genius and indefatigable application that enabled Bach to widen at every point the domain of musical expression.  His successors have failed to maintain the art at the level to which he raised it.  If Bach was more successful, if he was able to produce great work of convincing beauty and imperishable as a model for those who came after him, we owe it as much to his application as to his genius.', 'This man, the greatest orator-poet that ever addressed the world in the language of music, was a German!  Let Germany be proud of him!  Yes, proud of him, but worthy of him too! [The Bach Statue at Leipzig]  The Bach Statue at Leipzig', ' '];
